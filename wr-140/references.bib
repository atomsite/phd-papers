                   rates from WC dustars, asymptotic giant branch stars

                   thought to be immediate precursors to the supernova
                   terminating their brief lives. The existence of dust
                   shells around such stars has been enigmatic since
                   their discovery some 30 years ago; the intense
                   radiation field from the star should be inimical to
                   dust survival. Although dust-creation models,
                   including those involving interacting stellar winds
                   from a companion star, have been put forward,
                   high-resolution observations are required to
                   understand this phenomena. Here we present resolved
                   images of the dust outflow around Wolf-Rayet WR 104,
                   obtained with novel imaging techniques, revealing
                   detail on scales corresponding to about 40 AU at the
                   star. Our maps show that the dust forms a spatially
                   confined stream following precisely a linear (or
                   Archimedian) spiral trajectory. Images taken at two
                   separate epochs show a clear rotation with a period
                   of 220 +/- 30 days. Taken together, these findings
                   prove that a binary star is responsible for the
                   creation of the circumstellar dust, while the spiral
                   plume makes WR 104 the prototype of a new class of
                   circumstellar nebulae unique to interacting wind

  abstract =      {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} WR104 is an emblematic
                   dusty Wolf-Rayet star and the prototypical member of
                   a sub-group hosting spirals that are mainly
                   observable with high-angular resolution techniques.
                   Previous aperture masking observations showed that
                   WR104 is likely to be an interacting binary star at
                   the end of its life. However, several aspects of the
                   system are still unknown. This includes the opening
                   angle of the spiral, the dust formation locus, and
                   the link between the central binary star and a
                   candidate companion star detected with the
                   \emph{Hubble{$<$}i/{$>$} Space Telescope (HST) at
                   1{${'}{'}$}.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our aim was to
                   directly image the dusty spiral or ``pinwheel''
                   structure around WR104 for the first time and
                   determine its physical properties at large spatial
                   scales. We also wanted to address the characteristics
                   of the candidate companion detected by the
                   HST.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} For this purpose, we
                   used SPHERE and VISIR at the Very Large Telescope to
                   image the system in the near- and mid-infrared,
                   respectively. Both instruments furnished an excellent
                   view of the system at the highest angular resolution
                   a single, ground-based telescope can provide. Based
                   on these direct images, we then used analytical and
                   radiative transfer models to determine several
                   physical properties of the
                   system.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Employing a
                   different technique than previously used, our new
                   images have allowed us to confirm the presence of the
                   dust pinwheel around the central star. We have also
                   detected up to five revolutions of the spiral pattern
                   of WR104 in the \emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$} band for the
                   first time. The circumstellar dust extends up to 2
                   arcsec from the central binary star in the
                   \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$} band, corresponding to the past
                   20 yr of mass loss. Moreover, we found no clear
                   evidence of a shadow of the first spiral coil onto
                   the subsequent ones, which likely points to a dusty
                   environment less massive than inferred in previous
                   studies. We have also confirmed that the stellar
                   candidate companion previously detected by the HST is
                   gravitationally bound to WR104 and herein provide
                   information about its nature and orbital
                   elements.}}}}}}}},

                   recent large-scale spectroscopic surveys. Application
                   to 246 WR stars located in the field permits us to
                   map their Galactic distribution. As anticipated, WR
                   stars generally lie in the thin disc ({$\sim$}40\,pc

                   stars located at vertical distances
                   of~{$\geq$}300\,pc from the mid-plane. Analysis of
                   the radial variation in WR subtypes exposes a

                   stellar evolutionary models accounting for stellar
                   rotation. Models for non-rotating stars or accounting
                   for close binary evolution are more consistent with
                   observations. We consolidate information acquired
                   about the known WR content of the Milky Way to build
                   a simple model of the complete population. We derive
                   observable quantities over a range of wavelengths,
                   allowing us to estimate a total number of
                   1900\,~{$\pm~$}\,250 Galactic WR stars, implying an
                   average duration of~{$\sim$}\,0.4\,Myr for the WR
                   phase at the current Milky Way star formation rate.
                   Of relevance to future spectroscopic surveys, we use
                   this model WR population to predict follow-up

                   stellar winds is effective in a well-defined spiral
                   pattern, where optimal conditions for dust creation
                   are met. When radiative cooling is incorporated, the
                   interaction gets dominated by thermal instabilities
                   along the wind collision region, and dust
                   concentrates in clumps and filaments in a
                   volume-filling fashion, so WR 98a must obey close to
                   adiabatic evolutions to demonstrate the rotating
                   pinwheel structure. We mimic Keck, ALMA or future
                   E-ELT observations and confront photometric long-term
                   monitoring. We predict an asymmetry in the dust
                   distribution between leading and trailing edge of the
                   spiral, show that ALMA and E-ELT would be able to
                   detect fine-structure in the spiral indicative of
                   Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz development, and confirm
                   the variation in photometry due to the orientation.
                   Historic Keck images are reproduced, but their
                   resolution is insufficient to detect the details we
                   predict.},

                   adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) calculations is
                   described. It is intended primarily for applications
                   in astrophysical fluid dynamics, but its flexible and
                   modular design enables its use for a wide variety of
                   physics. The framework works with both uniform and
                   nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear
                   coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution
                   model based on a simple design called a "task list"
                   that improves parallel performance by overlapping
                   communication and computation, simplifies the
                   inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even
                   enables multiphysics models involving different
                   physics in different regions of the calculation. We
                   describe physics modules implemented in this
                   framework for both non-relativistic and relativistic
                   magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt
                   mature and robust algorithms originally developed for
                   the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions:
                   support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order
                   time integrators, more realistic physics such as a
                   general equation of state, and diffusion terms that
                   can be integrated with super-time-stepping
                   algorithms. The modules show excellent performance
                   and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efficiency
                   on over half a million threads. The source code has

                   The resulting grain potentials are (for temperatures

                   very hot gas. Rapid rotation can also disrupt small
                   grains, but damping (by microwave emission) usually

                   heated dust grains in fast ({$\geq$} 400 km s-1)
                   astrophysical shocks in order to develop IR
                   diagnostics for the destruction of grains in these
                   environments. The calculations take into account the
                   feedback from sputtering and IR emission on the
                   gas-phase abundances, the cooling, and the ionization
                   and thermal structure of the shock. Sputtering
                   changes the initial grain size distribution, creating
                   a deficiency of small (radius {$<$}50 \AA ) grains
                   compared to their preshock abundances. The altered
                   grain size distribution depends on shock velocity and
                   the density of the interstellar medium. Dust
                   particles with sizes below {$\asymp$}300 \AA{} are
                   stochastically heated, undergo temperature
                   fluctuations, and radiate an excess of near-infrared
                   emission ({$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 40 {$\mu$}m) over that
                   expected for grains in thermal equilibrium. This
                   near-infrared excess is a measure of the abundance of
                   small grains and therefore a powerful diagnostic for
                   the amount of destruction the grains were subjected
                   to in the shock. We present here IR spectra from
                   collisionally heated dust for a variety of shocks,
                   and depict the changes in the spectra as a function
                   of postshock column density. Our studies compliment
                   those of Vancura et al. that examined the effects of
                   the release of the sputtered refractory elements on
                   the ultraviolet and X-ray emission. Multiwavelength
                   observations at X-ray, UV, and IR wavelengths are
                   therefore essential in piecing together a

                   hot-star binaries these winds can undergo violent
                   collision. Because such winds are thought to be
                   radiatively driven, radiative forces may also play an
                   important role in moderating the wind collision.
                   However, previous studies have been limited to
                   considering how such forces may inhibit the initial
                   acceleration of the companion stellar wind. In this
                   paper we analyze the role of an even stronger
                   radiative braking effect, whereby the primary wind is
                   rather suddenly decelerated by the radiative momentum
                   flux it encounters as it approaches a bright
                   companion. We further show that the braking location
                   and velocity law along the line of centers between
                   the stars can be approximated analytically using a
                   simple one-dimensional analysis. The results of this
                   analysis agree well with a detailed two-dimensional
                   hydrodynamical simulation of the wind collision in
                   the WR + O binary V444 Cygni and demonstrate that
                   radiative braking can significantly alter the
                   bow-shock geometry and reduce the strength of the
                   wind collision. We then apply the derived analytic
                   theory to a set of 14 hot-star binary systems, and
                   conclude that radiative braking is likely to be of

                   early-type binaries may be strong sources of both
                   high-energy particles and nonthermal emission.
                   Nonthermal radio emission may be observed only if the
                   orbital period of the binary is more than some
                   critical value. For a typical Wolf-Rayet binary the
                   value of the critical period is of the order of a
                   month when the frequency of observation is a few GHz.
                   Observations of nonthermal radio emission of the
                   remarkable Wolf-Rayet binary WR 140, such as
                   luminosity, spectrum, time variability in the process
                   of orbital motion, the size of nonthermal radio
                   source, etc., are explained by a model in which its
                   nonthermal radio emission is generated at the site of
                   stellar wind collision. Considerations of shock
                   acceleration theory suggest that the WR 140 system
                   may be a strong source of gamma-rays. It is proposed
                   that EGRET could both measure the time dependence of
                   the gamma-ray emission as well as resolve an inverse
                   Compton spectrum from a pion decay spectrum and
                   thereby provide information on the electron versus
                   proton content of the relativistic particles.},

                   methods are a specific type of time discretization
                   method that have been widely used for the time
                   evolution of hyperbolic partial differential
                   equations (PDEs). Under a suitable stepsize
                   restriction, these methods share a desirable
                   nonlinear stability property with the underlying PDE,
                   e.g., stability with respect to total variation, the
                   maximum norm, or other convex functional. This is of
                   particular interest when the solution exhibits
                   shock-like or other nonsmooth behavior. Many results
                   are known for SSPRK methods with nonnegative
                   coefficients. However, it has recently been shown
                   that such methods cannot exist with order greater
                   than 4. In this paper, we give a systematic treatment
                   of explicit SSPRK methods with general (i.e.,
                   possibly negative) coefficients up to order 5. In
                   particular, we show how to optimally treat negative
                   coefficients (corresponding to a change in the upwind
                   direction of the spatial discretization) in the
                   context of effective CFL coefficient maximization and
                   provide proofs of optimality of some explicit SSPRK
                   methods of orders 1 to 4. We also give the first
                   known explicit fifth-order SSPRK schemes and show
                   their effectiveness in practice versus more
                   well-known fifth-order explicit Runge-Kutta schemes.},

                   observed between 1989 and 2001. The images resolve
                   the dust cloud formed by WR 140 in 2001, allowing us
                   to track its expansion and cooling, while the
                   photometry allows tracking the average temperature
                   and total mass of the dust. The combination of the
                   two data sets constrains the optical properties of
                   the dust, and suggests that they differ from those of
                   the dust made by the WC9 dust-makers, including the
                   classical `pinwheel', WR 104. The photometry of
                   individual dust emission features shows them to be
                   significantly redder in (nbL \textendash [3.99]), but
                   bluer in ([7.9]\textendash [12.5]), than the binary,
                   as expected from the spectra of heated dust and the
                   stellar wind of a Wolf\textendash Rayet star. The
                   most persistent dust features, two concentrations at
                   the ends of a `bar' of emission to the south of the
                   star, were observed to move with constant proper
                   motions of 324 {$\pm$} 8 and 243 {$\pm$} 7 mas yr-1.
                   Longer wavelength (4.68 and 12.5 {$\mu$}m) images
                   show dust emission from the corresponding features
                   from the previous (1993) periastron passage and dust
                   formation episode, showing that the dust expanded
                   freely in a low-density void for over a decade, with
                   dust features repeating from one cycle to the next. A
                   third persistent dust concentration to the east of
                   the binary (the `arm') was found to have a proper
                   motion {$\sim$}320 mas yr-1, and a dust mass about
                   one-quarter that of the `bar'. Extrapolation of the
                   motions of the concentrations back to the binary
                   suggests that the eastern `arm' began expansion four
                   to five months earlier than those in the southern
                   `bar', consistent with the projected rotation of the
                   binary axis and wind-collision region (WCR) on the
                   sky. A comparison of model dust images and the
                   observations constrains the intervals when the WCR
                   was producing sufficiently compressed wind for dust
                   nucleation in the WCR, and suggests that the
                   distribution of this material was not uniform about
                   the axis of the WCR, but more abundant in the
                   following edge in the orbital plane.},

                   star atmospheres. The force is increased over that
                   due to resonance lines alone so that rates of mass
                   loss are obtained which are 100 times greater than
                   previously thought possible. The force is related to
                   the solution of the line-transfer problem, and it
                   becomes a function of the local velocity gradient. A
                   new stellar wind theory, with a different
                   interpretation of the singular point, is developed to
                   treat this situation. The rate of mass loss, and
                   other properties of the model, are uniquely specified
                   by the luminosity, mass, and radius of the star.
                   Alternative static models do not exist. Numerical
                   results give a rate of mass loss 6 x 10``6
                   221\textcopyright{} per year for an 05 star, with a
                   terminal velocity of 1500 km s``1. The rate of mass
                   loss is sensitive to stellar parameters, while the
                   terminal velocity is not. The continuum optical depth
                   in the expanding envelope is about 0.16, of the right
                   order to explain the reduced brightness temperature
                   observed in \textsterling{} Pup. There is sufficient
                   mass in the envelope for recombination to produce the
                   emission lines of H and of He n which are observed,
                   with approximately the proper strength. The rate of
                   mass loss corresponds to a loss of more than 25
                   percent of the star's mass during main-sequence
                   hydrogen burning, with obvious consequences for
                   stellar evolution, and with the possibility of
                   modified surface abundances.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of the wind\textendash wind collision in massive stellar binaries are investigated using 3D hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds, the orbital motion of the stars and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. In this first paper, we restrict our study to main-sequence O+O binaries. The nature of the wind\textendash wind collision region is highly dependent on the degree of cooling of the shocked plasma, and the ratio of the flow time-scale of the shocked plasma to the orbital time-scale. The pre-shock wind speeds are lower in close systems as the winds collide prior to their acceleration to terminal speeds. Radiative inhibition may also reduce the pre-shock wind speeds. Together, these effects can lead to rapid cooling of the post-shock gas. Radiative inhibition is less important in wider systems, where the winds are accelerated to higher speeds before they collide, and the resulting collision region can be largely adiabatic. In systems with eccentric orbits, cold gas formed during periastron passage can persist even at apastron, before being ablated and mixed into its surroundings and/or accelerated out of the system.},

The emission is calculated from 3D hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds, orbital motion of the stars and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. Changes in the amount of stellar occultation and circumstellar attenuation introduce phase-dependent X-ray variability in systems with circular orbits, while strong variations in the intrinsic emission also occur in systems with eccentric orbits. The X-ray emission in eccentric systems can display strong hysteresis, with the emission softer after periastron than at corresponding orbital phases prior to periastron, reflecting the physical state of the shocked plasma at these times.},

  abstract = {Suzaku observations of the Wolf\textendash Rayet (W\textendash R) binary WR\,140 (WC7pd+O5.5fc) were made at four different times around periastron passage in 2009 January. The spectra changed in shape and flux with the phase. As periastron approached, the column density of the low-energy absorption increased, which indicates that the emission from the wind\textendash wind collision plasma was absorbed by the dense W\textendash R wind. The spectra can be mostly fitted with two different components: a warm component with kBT = 0.3\textendash 0.6~keV and a dominant hot component with kBT {$\sim$} 3~keV. The emission measure of the dominant, hot component is not inversely proportional to the distance between the two stars. This can be explained by the O star wind colliding before it has reached its terminal velocity, leading to a reduction in its wind momentum flux. At phases closer to periastron, we discovered a cool plasma component in a recombining phase, which is less absorbed. This component may be a relic of the wind\textendash wind collision plasma, which was cooled down by radiation, and may represent a transitional stage in dust formation.},

The observational campaign consisted of a constructive collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers. It took place at six locations, including Teide Observatory, Observatoire de Haute Provence, Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and Observatoire du Mont M\'egantic. WR 140 is known as the archetype of colliding-wind binaries and it has a relatively long period (?8 yr) and high eccentricity (?0.9). We provide updated values for the orbital parameters, new estimates for the WR and O star masses and new constraints on the mass-loss rates and colliding-wind geometry.},
