  abstract = {Numerical values of the radiation pressure on spectral lines are presented for the envelopes of stars having spectral type O-G and any luminosity, metallicity, or velocity structure. The line acceleration is calculated using a tabulation of atomic lines that is complete for the elements H-Zn. The acceleration is found to be remarkably constant over the temperature range 50,000-10,000 K but to drop off sharply for cooler stars. The anomalous ionization observed in OB stars decreases the acceleration by a factor of as much as 2 from radiative equilibrium values. More than half of the acceleration comes from lines whose frequencies overlap with those of neighboring lines at some point in the wind. Line blanketing of the continuum flux by the wind becomes significant for mass loss rates above 10 to the -6th solar mass/yr. The predicted and observed mass loss rates are in complete agreement for the OB stars, and it is concluded that radiation pressure is the dominant mechanism driving the winds from these stars.},

Limiting cases of the plasma diffuse field coupling are calculated, and the resulting cooling functions are presented. Some functions are terminated before reaching 10 exp 4 K when the internal photoionization halts the cooling. The functions represent a self-consistent set of curves covering a wide grid of temperature and metallicities using recently published atomic data and processes.

This two-epoch imaging provides an expansion parallax and thus a practically assumption-free geometric distance to the nebula, d = 3.35 {$\pm$} 0.67 kpc. Combined with the global velocity distribution in the ejected nebula, this confirms the extreme runaway status of WR 124. WR stars embedded within such ejection nebulae at the point of core collapse would produce different supernova characteristics from those expected for stars surrounded by wind-filled cavities. In galaxies with extremely low ambient metallicity, Z {$<$}= 10-3 Z sun, {$\gamma$}-ray bursts originating from fast-moving runaway WR stars may produce afterglows which appear to be coming from regions with a relatively homogeneous circumburst medium.},

Space asteroseismology delivered the interior rotation rates of more than a thousand low- and intermediate-mass stars, revealing the following: {$\blacksquare$} Single stars rotate nearly uniformly during the core-hydrogen and core-helium burning phases. {$\blacksquare$} Stellar cores spin up to a factor of 10 faster than the envelope during the red giant phase. {$\blacksquare$} The angular momentum of the helium-burning core of stars is in agreement with the angular momentum of white dwarfs.Observations reveal a strong decrease of core angular momentum when stars have a convective core. Current theory of angular momentum transport fails to explain this. We propose improving the theory with a data-driven approach, whereby angular momentum prescriptions derived frommultidimensional (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations and theoretical considerations are continuously tested against modern observations. The TESS and PLATO space missions have the potential to derive the interior rotation of large samples of stars, including high-mass and metal-poor stars in binaries and clusters. This will provide the powerful observational constraints needed to improve theory and simulations.},

  abstract = {In situ research of cometary chemistry began when measurements from the Giotto mission at Comet 1P/Halley revealed the presence of complex organics in the coma. New telescopes and space missions have provided detailed remote and in situ measurements of the composition of cometary volatiles. Recently, the Rosetta mission to Comet 67P/Churyumov\textendash Gerasimenko (67P) more than doubled the number of parent species and the number of isotopic ratios known for comets. Forty of the 71 parent species have also been detected in pre- and protostellar clouds. Most isotopic ratios are nonsolar. This diverse origin is in contrast to that of the Sun, which received its material from the bulk of the collapsing cloud. The xenon isotopic ratios measured in 67P can explain the long-standing question about the origin of terrestrial atmospheric xenon. These findings strengthen the notion that comets are indeed an important link between the ISM and today's solar system including life on Earth. {$\blacksquare$} Nonsolar isotopic ratios for species such as Xe, N, S, and Si point to a nonhomogenized protoplanetary disk from which comets received their material. {$\blacksquare$} The similarity of the organic inventories of comets and presolar and protostellar material makes it plausible that this material was accreted almost unaltered by comets from the presolar stage. {$\blacksquare$} Large variations in the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in water for comets indicate a large range in the protoplanetary disk from which comets formed. {$\blacksquare$} The amount of organics delivered by comets to Earth may be highly significant.},

The X-ray spectra of WR 25 were well explained by a two-temperature plasma model with temperatures of 0.64{$\pm$}0.01 and 2.96{$\pm$}0.05 keV and are consistent with previous results. The orbital phase dependent local hydrogen column density was found to be maximum just after the periastron passage, when the WN type star is in front of the O star. The hard (2.0-10.0 keV) X-ray luminosity was linearly dependent on the inverse of binary separation which confirms that WR 25 is a colliding wind binary.},

Our analysis reveals phase-locked variations repeating consistently over many consecutive orbits, in agreement with an X-ray emission fully explained by thermal emission from the colliding winds in the 208-d orbit. We report on a significant deviation of the X-ray flux with respect to the 1/D trend (expected for adiabatic shocked winds) close to periastron passage. The absence of a drop in post-shock plasma temperature close to periastron suggests this break in trend cannot be explained in terms of reduced pre-shock velocities in this part of the orbit. Finally, NuSTAR data reveal a lack of hard X-ray emission (above 10.0 keV) above the background level. Upper limits on a putative non-thermal emission strongly suggest that the sensitivity of present hard X-ray observatories is not sufficient to detect non-thermal emission from massive binaries above 10 keV, unless the wind kinetic power is large enough to significantly feed particle acceleration in the wind-wind interaction.},

  abstract = {The origin of terrestrial volatiles remains one of the most puzzling questions in planetary sciences. The timing and composition of chondritic and cometary deliveries to Earth has remained enigmatic due to the paucity of reliable measurements of cometary material. This work uses recently measured volatile elemental ratios and noble gas isotope data from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G), in combination with chondritic data from the literature, to reconstruct the composition of~Earth's ancient atmosphere. Comets are found to have contributed \textasciitilde 20\% of atmospheric heavy noble gases (i.e., Kr and Xe) but limited amounts of other volatile elements (water, halogens and likely organic materials) to Earth. These cometary noble gases were likely mixed with chondritic - and not solar - sources to form the atmosphere. We show that an ancient atmosphere composed of chondritic and cometary volatiles is more enriched in Xe relative to the modern atmosphere, requiring that 8\textendash 12 times the present-day inventory of Xe was lost to space. This potentially resolves the long-standing mystery of Earth's ``missing xenon'', with regards to both Xe elemental depletion and isotopic fractionation in the atmosphere. The inferred Kr/H2O and Xe/H2O of the initial atmosphere suggest that Earth's surface volatiles might not have been fully delivered by the late accretion of volatile-rich carbonaceous chondrites. Instead, ``dry'' materials akin to enstatite chondrites potentially constituted a significant source of chondritic volatiles now residing on the Earth's surface. We outline the working hypotheses, implications and limitations of this model in the last section of this contribution.},

Yet, the ubiquity of planets in our galaxy suggests that planet formation is a robust mechanism. This chapter focuses on the earliest stages of planet formation, the growth of small dust grains towards the gravitationally bound ``planetesimals'', the building blocks of planets. We will introduce some of the key physics involved in the growth processes and discuss how they are expected to shape the global behavior of the solid content of disks.

Developing performance-sensitive code requires a programming language that puts programmers in control of how memory, processor time, and other system resources are used. The Rust systems programming language combines that control with a modern type system that catches broad classes of common mistakes, from memory management errors to interthread data races. With this practical guide, experienced systems programmers will learn how to successfully bridge the gap between performance and safety using Rust. Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora Tindall demonstrate how Rust's features put programmers in control over memory consumption and processor use by combining predictable performance with memory safety and trustworthy concurrency.

It has been suggested from infrared observations that one of the Wolf\textendash Rayet stars in Apep is launching an anisotropic wind. Here we present radio observations of Apep from 0.2 to 20\,GHz taken over 33~yr. The spectrum reveals an extremely steep turnover in the flux density at low frequencies, where the flux density decreases by two orders of magnitude over only 325\,MHz of bandwidth. This exponential decline is best described by free\textendash free absorption, with a turnover frequency at 0.54~{$\pm$} 0.01\,GHz. Above the turnover, the spectrum is well described by a power-law and a high-frequency cut-off likely caused by inverse-Compton cooling. The light curve of Apep shows significant variation over the observing period, with Apep brightening by over 50\,mJy in a span of 25~yr at 1.4\,GHz. Models that assume spherical winds do not replicate all of the structure evident in the radio light curve. We derived a model that allows one of the winds in the system to be anisotropic. This anisotropic model recovers most of the structure of the light curve and is a significantly better statistical fit to the data than the spherical wind model. We suggest such a result is independent support that one of the Wolf\textendash Rayet stars in Apep is launching an anisotropic wind. If the anisotropic wind model is correct, we predict a {$\sim$}25~per~cent decrease of the 1.4\,GHz flux density of Apep over the next 5 yr.},

I discuss how massive-star formation can be understood as being due to competitive accretion in stellar clusters. Massive binary systems are then formed due to accretion onto wider low-mass systems. The combination of accretion and dynamical interactions with other stars in the cluster then result in producing a close binary system. Tidal and 3-body captures in dense stellar cores can also play a role in forming massive binary systems while stellar mergers of such close binary systems due to interactions may play an important role in overcoming the radiation pressure.},

In particular, the response of the model to periodic driving at its inner boundary was examined for a considerable range of stellar parameters for both fundamental and overtone modes, various driving amplitudes, and various assumptions about the physical processes involved; radiation pressure on dust and time-dependent temperature relaxation were included. Stable steady state models with periodic shocks were obtained in all cases. Both shocks and dust were found to be essential for rapid mass loss. The shocks increase the density and thus greatly increase the amount of dust formed in the cool outer atmosphere. Radiation pressure accelerates the grains, which drive a slow cool wind. Calculated mass-loss rates appear to be of the right order of magnitude to agree with observations and show how mass loss can be expected to depend on the stellar parameters.},

The force is increased over that due to resonance lines alone so that rates of mass loss are obtained which are 100 times greater than previously thought possible. The force is related to the solution of the line-transfer problem, and it becomes a function of the local velocity gradient. A new stellar wind theory, with a different interpretation of the singular point, is developed to treat this situation. The rate of mass loss, and other properties of the model, are uniquely specified by the luminosity, mass, and radius of the star. Alternative static models do not exist. Numerical results give a rate of mass loss 6 x 10``6 221\textcopyright{} per year for an 05 star, with a terminal velocity of 1500 km s``1. The rate of mass loss is sensitive to stellar parameters, while the terminal velocity is not. The continuum optical depth in the expanding envelope is about 0.16, of the right order to explain the reduced brightness temperature observed in \textsterling{} Pup. There is sufficient mass in the envelope for recombination to produce the emission lines of H and of He n which are observed, with approximately the proper strength. The rate of mass loss corresponds to a loss of more than 25 percent of the star's mass during main-sequence hydrogen burning, with obvious consequences for stellar evolution, and with the possibility of modified surface abundances.},

  abstract = {The formation of small carbon chains and molecular precursors to silicon  carbide grains is investigated in the hot, hostile environment of carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) winds. We consider only WC stars which produce dust on a continuous basis and develop for the first time non-equilibrium, chemical kinetic routes to nucleating dust precursors in the outflow. These can be used to calculate quantitatively the yield of such dust precursors for various outflow scenarios. Because WC stars have lost all their hydrogen in the WN phase, the chemical processes used in the model involve a pure helium, carbon, oxygen, silicon and sulphur chemistry which resembles that encountered in graphite or metal vaporization experiments in the laboratory. We derive abundances for small linear carbon clusters up to C\_6 and silicon-bearing species for various wind parameters and conclude that high-density regions in the form of clumps or discs are of paramount importance to the formation of dust in WC stars.

Chemical concentration profiles are calculated for several envelope models by integrating the coupled continuity equations that include spherically expanding flows from an inner boundary at the shock formation radius. The influence of the 'inverse greenhouse' effect experienced by small PAHs is investigated and shown to increase the PAH yield by many orders of magnitude. It is shown that the route through propargyl radicals could be an important channel to produce benzene. PAH formation yields are found to be extremely sensitive to gas density and temperature and are much smaller than values inferred from the observed dust content of late-type carbon-rich stellar envelopes. It is therefore unlikely that aromatic molecules are generated in the stellar outflow itself.},

  abstract = {We have undertaken a statistical study of the component mass ratios and the orbital eccentricities of WR + O close binary, detached main-sequence (DMS), contact early-type (CE), and semidetached (SD) systems. A comparison of the characteristics of WR + O systems and of DMS, CE, and SD systems has enabled us to draw certain conclusions about the evolutionary paths of WR + O binaries and to demonstrate that up to 90\% of all known WR + O binaries formed as a result of mass transfer in massive close O + O binary systems. Since there is a clear correlation between the component masses in SD systems with subgiants, the absence of an anticorrelation between the masses of the WR stars and O stars in WR + O binaries cannot be considered evidence against the formation of WR + O binaries via mass transfer. The spectroscopic transitional orbital period Ptrspcorresponding to the transition from nearly circular orbits (esp{$<$}0.1) to elliptical orbits (esp{$\geq$}0.1) is {$\sim$}14d for WR + O systems and {$\sim$}2d\textendash 3d for OB + OB systems. The period range in which all WR + O orbits are circular \$\$(1\textbackslash mathop d\textbackslash limits\_. 6 \textbackslash leqslant P \textbackslash leqslant 14\^d )\$\$is close to the range for SD systems with subgiants, \$\$0\textbackslash mathop d\textbackslash limits\_. 7 \textbackslash leqslant P \textbackslash leqslant 15\^d \$\$. The large difference between the Ptrspvalues for WR + O and OB + OB systems suggests that a mechanism of orbit circularization additional to that for OB + OB systems at the DMS stage (tidal dissipation of the orbital energy due to radiative damping of the dynamical tides) acts in WR + O binaries. It is natural to suggest mass transfer in the parent O + O binaries as this supplementary orbit-circularization mechanism. Since the transitional period between circular and elliptical orbits for close binaries with convective envelopes and ages of 5\texttimes 109 years is \$\$P\_\{tr\}  = 12\textbackslash mathop d\textbackslash limits\_. 4\$\$, the orbits of most known SD systems with subgiants had enough time to circularize during the DMS stage, prior to the mass transfer. Thus, for most SD systems, mass transfer plays a secondary role in circularization of their orbits.},

We attribute an absorption feature at 6.2 mm in the spectra of WC stars to amorphous carbon dust. This absorption feature is not detected in the diffuse interstellar medium toward the WR 147, Cyg OB2 No. 12, or the Pistol Star, and therefore we suggest that it is circumstellar in nature. In addition, we detect a broad absorption feature extending from approximately 6.5 to 8 mm. We tentatively attribute this absorption to the C i C stretching modes that accompany the 6.2 mm band in aromatic materials. Our analysis of the 6.2 mm absorption profile suggests that the dust grains have to be rather large ({$\sim$}1 mm) and point toward dense clumps as the sites of dust formation.},

We have performed a vast high-resolution radial velocity spectroscopic survey of about 250 O- and 540 B-type stars in the southern Milky Way which indicates that the majority of stars ({$>$}82 per cent) with masses above 16 M{$\odot$} form close binary systems while this fraction rapidly drops to 20 per cent for stars of 3 M{$\odot$}. The binary fractions of O-type stars among different environment classes are: clusters (72 {$\pm$} 13 per cent), associations (73 {$\pm$} 8 per cent), field (43 {$\pm$} 13 per cent) and runaways (69 {$\pm$} 11 per cent). The high frequency of close pairs with components of similar mass argues in favour of a multiplicity originating from the formation process rather than from a tidal capture in a dense cluster. The high binary frequency of runaway O stars that we found in our survey (69 per cent compared to 19-26 per cent in previous surveys) points to the importance of ejection from young star clusters and thus supports the competitive accretion scenario.},

  abstract = {We present a quantitative classification scheme for carbon and oxygen sequence Wolf-Rayet stars. Our scheme uses new high-quality optical AAT and INT observations of 20 stars for which we provide narrow-band photometry and estimates of interstellar reddenings. In increasing order of excitation, our spectral classes range from WC11 to WC4 for Wolf-Rayet stars with a dominant carbon line visual spectrum, and subsequently from WO4 to WO1 for those with predominantly oxygen lines. We refine existing WC and WO schemes to incorporate stars with higher and lower excitation spectral features. Both massive stars and central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) can be classified with the unified system. We have found no criterion that cleanly separates spectra of the two types of star, including elemental abundances (C/O or C/He). However, CSPNe show a wider range of line strength and width than massive stars in the same ionization subclass. Systematically lower FWHM(Civ lambda5808) values are observed from WO-type CSPNe than from massive WO stars. For WC4-11 stars, our primary diagnostic is the equivalent width or line flux ratio Civ lambdalambda5801-12/Ciiilambda5696. We extend the use of this as the principal criterion throughout the WC sequence, with few reclassifications necessary relative to Smith, Shara \& Moffat. For WO stars, Ciii is absent and our new criteria, using primarily oxygen lines, take over smoothly. We define subclasses WO4-1, using Ovi lambdalambda3811-34/Ov lambda5590 as our primary diagnostic. The continuation in spectral sequence from WC to WO is used to indicate that the sequence is a result primarily of excitation effects, rather than significant abundance differences. Our scheme allows us to confirm that massive stars and CSPNe are differently distributed over the subclasses. Around 3/5 of massive WC stars lie within the range WC5-8, while {$<$}=1/5 of CSPNe are found within these spectral types. Stars within both the highest (WO1) and lowest (WC10-11) excitation spectral classes are unique to CSPNe. A WC classification for the hot RCrB star V348 Sgr is excluded (previously [WC12]) since both Ciii lambda5696 and Civ lambda5808 are absent in its optical spectrum. Additional criteria allow us to distinguish between WC-type, `weak emission line' CSPNe, and O stars, allowing us to reclassify the central star of IRAS 21282+5050 (previously [WC11]) as an O star.},

  abstract = {We model the combined effects of photoionization and momentum-driven winds from O-stars on molecular clouds spanning a parameter space of initial conditions. The dynamical effects of the winds are very modest. However, in the lower mass clouds, they influence the morphologies of the H II regions by creating 10-pc-scale central cavities. The inhomogeneous structures of the model giant molecular clouds (GMCs) make them highly permeable to photons, ionized gas and supernova ejecta, and the leaking of ionized gas in particular strongly affects their evolution, reducing the effectiveness of feedback. Nevertheless, feedback is able to expel large fractions of the mass of the lower escape velocity clouds. Its impact on star formation is more modest, decreasing final star formation efficiencies by 10\textendash 20 per cent, and the rate of change of the star formation efficiency per freefall time by about one third. However, the clouds still form stars substantially faster than observed GMCs.},

To mimic the exact interstellar condition, gas grain interactions via accretion from the gas phase and desorption (thermal evaporation and photo-evaporation) from the grain surface are considered. We find that the chemical composition of the interstellar grain mantle is highly dependent on the physical parameters associated with a molecular cloud. Interstellar photons are seen to play an important role towards the growth and the structure of the interstellar grain mantle. We consider the effects of interstellar photons (photo-dissociation and photo-evaporation) in our simulation under various interstellar conditions. We notice that the effects of interstellar photons dominate around the region of lower visual extinction. These photons contribute significantly in the formation of the grain mantle. Energy of the incoming photon is attenuated by the absorption and scattering by the interstellar dust. Top most layers are mainly assumed to be affected by the incoming radiation. We have studied the effects of photo-dissociation by varying the number of layers which could be affected by it. Model calculations are carried out for the static (extinction parameter is changing with the density of the cloud) as well as the time dependent case (i.e., extinction parameter and number density of the cloud both are changing with time) and the results are discussed in details. Different routes to the formation of water molecules are studied and it is noticed that around the dense region, production of water molecules via O3 and H2O2 contributes significantly. At the end, various observational evidences for the condensed phase species are summarized with their physical conditions and are compared with our simulation results.},

Some DAZs are known to have unresolved M dwarf companions, which could account for the observed accretion through a stellar wind. I combine observed Ca abundances of the DAZs with information on the orbital separation of their M dwarf companions to infer the mass-loss rate of the M dwarfs. I find that for three of the six known DAZs with M dwarf companions, a stellar wind can plausibly explain the observed accretion on the white dwarfs assuming Bondi-Hoyle accretion of solar abundance stellar winds on the order of 10-14 to 10-16 M{$\Sun$} yr-1. The rest of the sample have companions with orbits {$\greaterequivlnt$}1 AU and require companion mass-loss rates of {$>$}10-11 M{$\Sun$} yr-1. I conclude that there must be an alternative explanation for accretion of material onto DAZs with widely separated companions. The inferred winds for two of the close binaries are orders of magnitude smaller than typically assumed for the angular momentum loss of red dwarf-white dwarf pairs due to magnetic braking from a stellar wind and may seriously affect predictions for the formation rate of CVs with low-mass companions.},

This makes this particular system of great interest to investigate stellar winds and the non-thermal processes associated with their shocks. This source was detected at various radio bands, and in addition the wind-collision region was resolved by means of very-long baseline interferometric observations. We use a non-thermal emission model for colliding-wind binaries to derive physical properties of this system. The observed morphology in the resolved maps allows us to estimate the system projection angle on the sky to be \$\textbackslash psi \textbackslash approx 85\^\textbackslash circ\$. The observed radio flux densities also allow us to characterise both the intrinsic synchrotron spectrum of the source and its modifications due to free--free absorption in the stellar winds at low frequencies; from this we derive mass-loss rates of the stars of \$\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{WN\} \textbackslash approx 4\textbackslash times10\^\{-5\}\$ \$\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ yr\$\^\{-1\}\$ and \$\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{WC\} \textbackslash approx 2.9\textbackslash times10\^\{-5\}\$ \$\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ yr\$\^\{-1\}\$. Finally, the broadband spectral energy distribution is calculated for different combinations of the remaining free parameters, namely the intensity of the magnetic field and the injected power in non-thermal particles. We show that the degeneracy of these two parameters can be solved with observations in the high-energy domain, most likely in the hard X-rays but also possibly in \$\textbackslash gamma\$-rays under favourable conditions.},

Following the ground-breaking discovery that cool [WC] central stars harbor hot carbon- as well as hot oxygen-rich dust, current theories of their origin have been put in serious doubt. Observations of three cool [WC] central stars are presented here which, while confirming the deficiency of our theoretical understanding, hint at the possibility of alternative scenarios, such as dust-storing disks.},

We account for both thermal and synchrotron radio emission, free-free absorption in both the unshocked stellar wind envelopes and the shocked gas, synchrotron self-absorption, and the Razin effect. To calculate the synchrotron emission several simplifying assumptions are adopted: the relativistic particle energy density is a simple fraction of the thermal particle energy density, in equipartition with the magnetic energy density, and a power-law in energy. We also assume that the magnetic field is tangled such that the resulting emission is isotropic. The applicability of these calculations to modelling radio images and spectra of colliding-wind systems is demonstrated with models of the radio emission from the wide WR+OB binary WR 147. Its synchrotron spectrum follows a power-law between 5 and 15 GHz but turns down to below this at lower and higher frequencies. We find that while free-free opacity from the circum-binary stellar winds can potentially account for the low-frequency turnover, models that also include a combination of synchrotron self-absorption and Razin effect are favoured. We argue that the highfrequency turn down is a consequence of inverse-Compton cooling. We present our resulting spectra and intensity distributions, along with simulated MERLIN observations of these intensity distributions. From these we argue that the inclination of the WR 147 system to the plane of the sky is low. We summarise by considering extensions of the current model that are important for models of the emission from closer colliding wind binaries, in particular the dramatically varying radio emission of WR 140.},

Grain sputtering in spherically symmetric supernova remnants is investigated as a function of supernova energy and ambient density. The results are applied to consider the destruction of grains (1) in collisions between randomly moving interstellar clouds; (2) in supernovae in a 'one-phase', a 'two-phase', and a 'three-phase' ISM; (3) by sputtering in H II regions; (4) by cosmic-ray sputtering; (5) by UV photodesorption; and (6) by sublimation of volatile mantles from grains heated in H II regions or by supernova radiation.},

Even so, large electrostatic stresses can cause ion field emission and rapid destruction of small grains in very hot gas. Rapid rotation can also disrupt small grains, but damping (by microwave emission) usually limits the centrifugal stress to acceptable values for plasma densities of no more than about 1 per cu cm. Sputtering rates are estimated for grains in hot gas, based upon a semiempirical fit to experimental data. Predicted sputtering rates for possible grain constituents are similar to estimates by Barlow (1978), but in some cases differ significantly.

The calculations take into account the feedback from sputtering and IR emission on the gas-phase abundances, the cooling, and the ionization and thermal structure of the shock. Sputtering changes the initial grain size distribution, creating a deficiency of small (radius {$<$}50 \AA ) grains compared to their preshock abundances. The altered grain size distribution depends on shock velocity and the density of the interstellar medium. Dust particles with sizes below {$\asymp$}300 \AA{} are stochastically heated, undergo temperature fluctuations, and radiate an excess of near-infrared emission ({$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 40 {$\mu$}m) over that expected for grains in thermal equilibrium. This near-infrared excess is a measure of the abundance of small grains and therefore a powerful diagnostic for the amount of destruction the grains were subjected to in the shock. We present here IR spectra from collisionally heated dust for a variety of shocks, and depict the changes in the spectra as a function of postshock column density. Our studies compliment those of Vancura et al. that examined the effects of the release of the sputtered refractory elements on the ultraviolet and X-ray emission. Multiwavelength observations at X-ray, UV, and IR wavelengths are therefore essential in piecing together a comprehensive picture of the physics of grain destruction in fast astrophysical shocks.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the stellar wind collisions in early-type binaries may  be strong sources of both high-energy particles and nonthermal emission. Nonthermal radio emission may be observed only if the orbital period of the binary is more than some critical value. For a typical Wolf-Rayet binary the value of the critical period is of the order of a month when the frequency of observation is a few GHz. Observations of nonthermal radio emission of the remarkable Wolf-Rayet binary WR 140, such as luminosity, spectrum, time variability in the process of orbital motion, the size of nonthermal radio source, etc., are explained by a model in which its nonthermal radio emission is generated at the site of stellar wind collision. Considerations of shock acceleration theory suggest that the WR 140 system may be a strong source of gamma-rays. It is proposed that EGRET could both measure the time dependence of the gamma-ray emission as well as resolve an inverse Compton spectrum from a pion decay spectrum and thereby provide information on the electron versus proton content of the relativistic particles.},

Here, we present an extensive search for the progenitors of Type Ibc SNe in all available pre-discovery imaging since 1998. There are 12 Type Ibc SNe with no detections of progenitors in either deep ground-based or Hubble Space Telescope archival imaging. The deepest absolute BVR magnitude limits are between -4 and - 5\,mag. We compare these limits with the observed Wolf\textendash Rayet population in the Large Magellanic Cloud and estimate a 16~per\,cent probability that we have failed to detect such a progenitor by chance. Alternatively, the progenitors evolve significantly before core-collapse or we have underestimated the extinction towards the progenitors. Reviewing the relative rates and ejecta mass estimates from light-curve modelling of Ibc SNe, we find both incompatible with Wolf\textendash Rayet stars with initial masses \&gt;25\,M{$\odot$} being the only progenitors. We present binary evolution models that fit these observational constraints. Stars in binaries with initial masses {$\lessequivlnt$} 20\,M{$\odot$} lose their hydrogen envelopes in binary interactions to become low-mass helium stars. They retain a low-mass hydrogen envelope until {$\approx$}104\,yr before core-collapse; hence, it is not surprising that Galactic analogues have been difficult to identify.},

Alongside more traditional topics, Vietri presents new subjects increasingly considered crucial to understanding high-energy astrophysical sources, including the electrodynamics of cosmic sources, new developments in the theory of standard accretion disks,~and the physics of coronae, thick disks, and accretion onto magnetized objects. The most thorough and engaging survey of high-energy astrophysics available today, Foundations of High-Energy Astrophysics introduces the main physical processes relevant to the field in a rigorous yet accessible way, while paying careful attention to observational issues. Vietri's book will quickly become a classic text for students and active researchers in astronomy and astrophysics.

The addition of the finite disk factor reduces the line force near the star and increases it far from the star, which lowers the mass-loss rate, increases the terminal velocity, and makes the velocity law more gradual. These changes bring the wind model into much closer agreement with observations of hot star winds. In particular, the decrease in the ratio of terminal velocity to escape velocity in the B sugergiants can now be explained as due to a change in the mixture of driving lines. Including a centrifugal force (in the equatorial plane) decreases the terminal velocity and increases the massloss rate, but neither effect is measurable in current data.},

  abstract = {Hot, massive stars have strong stellar winds, and in hot-star binaries these winds can undergo violent collision. Because such winds are thought to be radiatively driven, radiative forces may also play an important role in moderating the wind collision. However, previous studies have been limited to considering how such forces may inhibit the initial acceleration of the companion stellar wind. In this paper we analyze the role of an even stronger radiative braking effect, whereby the primary wind is rather suddenly decelerated by the radiative momentum flux it encounters as it approaches a bright companion. We further show that the braking location and velocity law along the line of centers between the stars can be approximated analytically using a simple one-dimensional analysis. The results of this analysis agree well with a detailed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the wind collision in the WR + O binary V444 Cygni and demonstrate that radiative braking can significantly alter the bow-shock geometry and reduce the strength of the wind collision. We then apply the derived analytic theory to a set of 14 hot-star binary systems, and conclude that radiative braking is likely to be of widespread importance for wind-wind collisions in WR + O binaries with close to medium separation, D \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] lesssim 100 R {$\Sun$} . It may also be important in other types of hot-star binaries that exhibit a large imbalance between the component wind strengths.},

Under the assumption of negligible orbital motion, the nebular shell reaches a steady-state configuration. Its shape is roughly conical, with the cone apex angle determined by a single parameter. The time development of a cross-section of the nebula which forms in a system with nonnegligible orbital motion is also calculated, under the assumption that the nebular shell is thin relative to its overall dimensions.},

We consider a very complete set of molecules and dust clusters, and combine the nucleation phase of dust formation with the condensation of these clusters into dust grains. We also test the impact of increasing the local gas density. Our derived molecular abundances and dust properties are compared to the most recent observational data. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: A semi-analytical formalism based on parameterised fluid equations is used to describe the gas density, velocity, and temperature in the inner wind. The chemistry is described by using a chemical kinetic network of reactions and the condensation mechanism is described by a Brownian formalism. A set of stiff, ordinary, coupled differential equations is solved, and molecular abundances, dust cluster abundances, grain size distributions and dust masses are derived. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The shocks drive an active non-equilibrium chemistry in the dust formation zone of IK Tau where the collision destruction of CO in the post-shock gas triggers the formation of C-bearing species such as HCN and CS. Most of the modelled molecular abundances agree well with the latest values derived from Herschel data, except for SO\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3}, whose formation may not occur in the inner wind. Clusters of alumina, Al\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}, are produced within 2 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} and lead to a population of alumina grains close to the stellar surface. Clusters of silicates (Mg\textsubscript{2}SiO\textsubscript{4}) form at larger radii (r\&gt; 3R\textsubscript{{$\star$}}), where their nucleation is triggered by the formation of HSiO and H\textsubscript{2}SiO. They efficiently condense and reach their final grain size distribution between \textasciitilde 6 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} and 8 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} with a major population of medium size grains peaking at \textasciitilde 200 \AA. This two dust-shell configuration agrees with recent interferometric observations. The derived dust-to-gas mass ratio for IK Tau is in the range 1-6 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-3} and agrees with values derived from observations of O-rich Mira-type stars. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of periodic shocks in chemically shaping the inner wind of AGB stars and providing gas conditions conducive to the efficient synthesis of molecules and dust by non-equilibrium processes. They indicate that the wind acceleration will possibly develop in the radius range 4-8 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} in IK Tau.},

We connect stellar structure models for He stars with wind models for optically-thick winds and assess how both types of models can simultaneously fulfill their respective sonic-point conditions. Results. Fixing the outer wind law and terminal wind velocity {$\infty$}, we obtain unique solutions for the mass-loss rates of opticallythick, radiatively-driven winds of WR stars in the phase of core He-burning. The resulting mass-loss relations as a function of stellar parameters, agree well with previous empirical relations. Furthermore, we encounter stellar mass limits below which no continuous solutions exist. While these mass limits agree with observations of WR stars in the Galaxy, they are in conflict with observations in the LMC. Conclusions. While our results confirm in particular the slope of oft-used empirical mass-loss relations, they imply that only part of the observed WN population can be understood in the framework of the standard assumptions of a smooth transonic flow and compact stellar core. This means that alternative approaches, such as a clumped and inflated wind structure, or deviations from the diffusion limit at the sonic point may have to be invoked. Qualitatively, the existence of mass limits for the formation of WR-type winds may be relevant for the non-detection of low-mass WR stars in binary systems, which are believed to be progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae. The sonic-point conditions derived in this work may provide a possibility to include optically-thick winds in stellar evolution models in a more physically motivated form than in current models.},

K-Athena achieves \${$>$}10\^8\$ cell-updates/s on a single V100 GPU for second-order double precision MHD calculations, and a speedup of 30 on up to 24,576 GPUs on Summit (compared to 172,032 CPU cores), reaching \$1.94\textbackslash times10\^\{12\}\$ total cell-updates/s at 76\% parallel efficiency. Using a roofline analysis we demonstrate that the overall performance is currently limited by DRAM bandwidth and calculate a performance portability metric of 62.8\%. Finally, we present the implementation strategies used and the challenges encountered in maximizing performance. This will provide other research groups with a straightforward approach to prepare their own codes for the exascale era. K-Athena is available at https://gitlab.com/pgrete/kathena .},

  abstract = {The interaction between the strong winds in stellar colliding-wind binary (CWB) systems produces two shock fronts, delimiting the wind-collision region (WCR). There, particles are expected to be accelerated mainly via diffusive shock acceleration. We investigate the injection and acceleration of protons in typical CWB systems by means of Monte Carlo simulations, with both a test-particle approach and a nonlinear method modeling a shock locally modified by the backreaction of the accelerated protons. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to determine the background plasma in the WCR and its vicinity. This allows us to consider particle acceleration at both shocks, on either side of the WCR, with a realistic large-scale magnetic field. We highlight the possible effects of particle acceleration on the local shock profiles at the WCR. We include the effect of magnetic field amplification, due to resonant-streaming instability, and compare results without and with the backreaction of the accelerated protons. In the latter case, we find a lower flux of the nonthermal proton population and a considerable magnetic field amplification. This would significantly increase the synchrotron losses of relativistic electrons accelerated in CWB systems, lowering the maximal energy they can reach and strongly reducing the inverse Compton fluxes. As a result, {$\gamma$}-rays from CWBs would be predominantly due to the decay of neutral pions produced in nucleon-nucleon collisions. This might provide a way to explain why, in the vast majority of cases, CWB systems have not been identified as {$\gamma$}-ray sources, although they emit synchrotron radiation.},

The collision of strong stellar winds in massive binary systems creates powerful shocks that have been expected to produce high-energy cosmic rays through Fermi acceleration at the shock interface. The accelerated particles should collide with stellar photons or ambient material, producing non-thermal emission observable in X-rays and {$\gamma$}-rays3,4. The supermassive binary star Eta Carinae ({$\eta$} Car) drives the strongest colliding wind shock in the solar neighbourhood5,6. Observations with non-focusing high-energy observatories indicate a high-energy source near {$\eta$} Car, but have been unable to conclusively identify {$\eta$} Car as the source because of their relatively poor angular resolution7\textendash 9. Here we present direct focussing observations of the non-thermal source in the extremely hard X-ray band, which is found to be spatially coincident with the star within several arc-seconds. These observations show that the source of non-thermal X-rays varies with the orbital phase of the binary, and that the photon index of the emission is similar to that derived through analysis of the {$\gamma$}-ray spectrum. This is conclusive evidence that the high-energy emission indeed originates from non-thermal particles accelerated at colliding wind shocks.},

Observational data pointed to a hierarchical triple-star system, however, several extreme and unexpected physical properties seem to defy the established physics of such objects. Most notably, a stark discrepancy was found in the observed outflow speed of the gas as measured spectroscopically in the line-of-sight direction compared to the proper motion expansion of the dust in the sky plane. This enigmatic behaviour arises at the wind base within the central Wolf\textendash Rayet binary: a system that has so far remained spatially unresolved. Here, we present an updated proper motion study deriving the expansion speed of Apep's dust plume over a 2-year baseline that is four times slower than the spectroscopic wind speed, confirming and strengthening the previous finding. We also present the results from high angular resolution near-infrared imaging studies of the heart of the system, revealing a close binary with properties matching a Wolf\textendash Rayet colliding-wind system. Based on these new observational constraints, an improved geometric model is presented yielding a close match to the data, constraining the orbital parameters of the Wolf\textendash Rayet binary and lending further support to the anisotropic wind model.},

  abstract = {We present radiative-transfer modelling of the dusty spiral Pinwheel Nebula observed around the Wolf\textendash Rayet/OB-star binary WR 104. The models are based on the three-dimensional radiative-transfer code torus, modified to include an adaptive mesh that allows us to adequately resolve both the inner spiral turns (subau scales) and the outer regions of the nebula (distances of 104 au from the central source). The spiral model provides a good fit to both the spectral energy distribution and Keck aperture masking interferometry, reproducing both the maximum entropy recovered images and the visibility curves. We deduce a dust creation rate of 8 {$\pm$} 1 \texttimes{} 10-7 M{$\odot$} yr-1, corresponding to approximately 2 per cent by mass of the carbon produced by the Wolf\textendash Rayet star. Simultaneous modelling of the imaging and spectral data enables us to constrain both the opening angle of the wind\textendash wind collision interface and the dust grain size. We conclude that the dust grains in the inner part of the Pinwheel Nebula are small ({$\sim$}100 \AA ), in agreement with theoretical predictions, although we cannot rule out the presence of larger grains ({$\sim$}1 {$\mu$}m) further from the central binary. The opening angle of the wind\textendash wind collision interface appears to be about 40\textdegree, in broad agreement with the wind parameters estimated for the central binary. We discuss the success and deficiencies of the model, and the likely benefits of applying similar techniques to the more complex nebulae observed around other WR/O star binaries.},

WR 98a hosts a WC9+OB star, and the presence of dust is puzzling given the extreme luminosities of Wolf\textendash Rayet stars. We present 3D hydrodynamic models for WR 98a, where dust creation and redistribution are self-consistently incorporated. Our grid-adaptive simulations resolve details in the wind collision region at scales below one percent of the orbital separation ({$\sim$}4 au), while simulating up to 1300 au. We cover several orbital periods under conditions where the gas component alone behaves adiabatic, or is subject to effective radiative cooling. In the adiabatic case, mixing between stellar winds is effective in a well-defined spiral pattern, where optimal conditions for dust creation are met. When radiative cooling is incorporated, the interaction gets dominated by thermal instabilities along the wind collision region, and dust concentrates in clumps and filaments in a volume-filling fashion, so WR 98a must obey close to adiabatic evolutions to demonstrate the rotating pinwheel structure. We mimic Keck, ALMA or future E-ELT observations and confront photometric long-term monitoring. We predict an asymmetry in the dust distribution between leading and trailing edge of the spiral, show that ALMA and E-ELT would be able to detect fine-structure in the spiral indicative of Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz development, and confirm the variation in photometry due to the orientation. Historic Keck images are reproduced, but their resolution is insufficient to detect the details we predict.},

At or near conjunction, the lines have approximately Gaussian profiles, with small widths (HWHM {$\sim$} 0.1v{$\infty$}) and definite blueshifts or redshifts (depending on whether the star with the weaker wind is in front or behind). When the system is viewed at quadrature, the lines are generally much broader (HWHM {$\sim$} v{$\infty$}), flat-topped and unshifted. Local absorption can have a major effect on the observed profiles \textendash{} in systems with mass-loss rates of a few times 10-6 M yr-1 the lower energy lines (E 1 keV) are particularly affected.

Although, with one exception, complex molecules have only been detected in the gas phase, there is strong evidence that they can be formed in ice mantles on interstellar grains. The nature of the gaseous complex species depends dramatically on the source where they are found: in cold, dense regions they tend to be unsaturated (hydrogen-poor) and exotic, whereas in young stellar objects, they tend to be quite saturated (hydrogen-rich) and terrestrial in nature. Based on both their spectra and chemistry, complex molecules are excellent probes of the physical conditions and history of the sources where they reside. Because they are detected in young stellar objects, complex molecules are expected to be common ingredients for new planetary systems.

This scenario, here referred to as Pulsation-Enhanced Dust-DRiven Outflow (PEDDRO), has passed a range of critical observational tests as models have developed from empirical and qualitative to increasingly self-consistent and quantitative. A reliable theory of mass loss is an essential piece in the bigger picture of stellar and galactic chemical evolution, and central for determining the contribution of AGB stars to the dust budget of galaxies. In this review, I discuss the current understanding of wind acceleration and indicate areas where further efforts by theorists and observers are needed.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of many close, evolved binaries can be understood most easily if there exists some agency that can abstract angular momentum or mass, or both, from the precursor system. Close binaries may be defined as systems in which at least one of the components has filled or will fill its Roche lobe and attempt to transfer matter to its companion. If the timescale for mass transfer is considerablyy shorter than the timescale on which the accretor can adjust thermally to the proferred mass, the accreted layer will heat up, expand, and fill the Roche lobe of the accretor. The mass lost by the donor thereafter flows into a "common envelope" (CE) which encomapsses both stars. The frictional interaction between this common envelope and the stellar cores produces drag forces that cause the cores to spiral in toward one another; some of the orbital energy helps drive matter from the CE into interstellar space. Examples of the systems which are experiencing or have experienced this process include some planetary nebulae, cataclysmic variables, and close binary degenerate stars. Similar situations can arise if one of the components can support, of its own accord, a dense wind that flows out of the system; the drag luminosity produced by interaction between the companion and the wind may intensify the wind and contribute tot eh mass loss from the donor. Systems undergoing this "wind-CE" process include novae and close binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet star. Planetary nebulae with close binary central stars are actually ejected CEs, and precursors of many cataclysmic variables were once the central stars of planetary nebulae formed in a CE event. In this review, we (1) describe various initial configurations which will produce a CE, (2) discuss the physics of the CE event, (3) describe attempts to model the event quantiatively, and (4) apply what we have learned to describe, in several real situations, the tarnsformations wrought by evolution through a CE phase.

  abstract = {Destruction of interstellar dust occurs predominantly in supernova shock waves in the warm neutral/ionized medium (density approximately = 0.25/cu cm, temperature approximately = 104 K). Recent theoretical developments and laboratory data for sputtering processes and grain-grain collisional vaporization allows us to better evaluate the grain destruction rate in interstellar shocks in the warm medium. We find that, independent of composition, grain destruction in supernova blast waves is dominated by nonthermal sputtering for shock velocities greater than 50 km/s and less than or equal to 150 km/s and thermal sputtering at higher shock velocities. We use a detailed scheme for the vaporization of grains colliding at high velocities (vs greater than or equal to 20 km/s) and show that the grain-grain collision destruction process is only dominant for shock velocities of less than or equal to 50-80 km/s and is less important than previously assumed. Nevertheless, the grain-grain destruction rates are of order 30\%-90\% of the sputtering rates at vs greater than 100 km/s and less than 200 km/s and are important in vaporizing the cores of grains. Detailed results for grain destruction as a function of grain size and composition are presented. We also present results for silicon carbide, iron, ice, and porous test particles. For carbonaceous grains we find that the fractional destruction is less than or equal to 0.29, and for silicate it is less than or equal to 0.45, for vs less than or equal to 200 km/s. We have calculated grain lifetimes, using the three-phase model of the interstellar medium, and find lifetimes of 4 x 108 yr for carbonaceous grains and 2.2 x 108 yr for silicate grains. Given that the typical stardust injection timescale of 2.5 x 109 yr, we conclude that efficient mechanisms for grain growth in the interstellar medium must exist in order that a significant fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust, as observed. Therefore, although our improved model has less vaporization of dust due to grain-grain collisions, sputtering still destroys dust efficiently and grain mantle growth in the interstellar medium is required, a conclusion reached in previous models of grain destruction in the interstellar medium. Carbonaceous mantles on silicate grains can protect the silicate cores from sputtering destruction in interstellar shock waves, provided that the protective mantles can efficiently reform in the interstellar medium. Also, if the grains are porous the postshock grain velocities are lower than for solid particles, and grain destruction is reduced. Porosity and mantling may increase the grain lifetime by factors of approximately 3 and approximately 3-4, respectively. The fraction of interstellar silicon in silicate stardust is therefore less than or equal to 0.25, but more silicon might be depleted in the form of a grain mantle.},

  abstract = {We have studied the effects of shattering in grain-grain collisions. Based upon extensive numerical simulation of surface explosions and impacts, an analytical model has been developed which relates the final crater mass and fragment size distribution to the relative collision velocity, grain sizes, and material properties of projectile and target. Our model contains one free parameter, the critical shock pressure for shattering. We have compared the calculated crater masses to laboratory experiments on (sub)micron-sized particle impacts on a wide variety of materials and find good agreement assuming that the critical pressure for shattering is equal to the shear strength of the material. This critical pressure corresponds to minimum collision velocities of {$\sim$}1 km s-1 for shattering to occur. The shattering threshold is much smaller than the vaporization threshold, and we therefore conclude that shattering dominates over vaporization in grain-grain collisions. The calculated size distribution of the shattered fragments scales with a a-3.3; slightly less steep than the Mathis, Rumpl, \& Nordsieck (MRN) size distribution. Essentially, any shattering model where the size of the fragments is related to the pressure experienced will lead to fragment power-law size distributions with indices slightly steeper than {$\sim$}3. The maximum fragment size increases with increasing crater size (i.e., increasing collision velocity) until the target grain is completely disrupted by the collision. For higher velocity collisions, our theory predicts that the maximum shattered fragment size will decrease again. Dust destruction (return of grain mass to the gas) in the interstellar medium occurs predominantly in shock waves in the warm neutral/ionized medium (density {$\simeq$}0.25 cm-3, temperature {$\sim$}104 K). The new theory for grain shattering in grain-grain collisions has been incorporated into a grain destruction code and used to reevaluate the grain destruction rate in interstellar shocks in the warm medium. We find that, for all the grain materials we consider (graphite, silicate, silicon carbide, diamond, iron, and ice) nonthermal and thermal sputtering dominate the grain destruction. We also find that grain disruption (shattering) in grain-grain collisions dominates the grain mass redistribution. We present detailed results for grain destruction as a function of the grain size and composition. In particular, we consider MRN size distributions of silicate and carbonaceous (amorphous carbon/ graphite) grains. We also present results for silicon carbide, diamond, iron, and ice test particles. For both carbonaceous and silicate grains we find that the fractional destruction (i.e., return of solid material to the gas phase) is {$\leq$}0.5, for vs {$\leq$}200 km s-1 . The grain lifetimes against destruction, assuming the three-phase model of the interstellar medium, are 6 x 108 yr, and 4 x 108 yr, for carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively, only slightly longer than previous studies that ignored shattering. Grain shattering in grain-grain collisions in shock waves leads to the redistribution of the dust mass from large grains (a {$\geq$} 1000 \AA ) into small grains (a {$<$} 500 \AA ). After processing by a single shock, a major fraction of the grains larger than 300 A have experienced shattering grain-grain collisions. The slope of the fragment size distribution produced in single collisions has little influence on the size distribution produced by shocks. Essentially, the resulting grain size distribution is slightly steeper than MRN, because the largest grains move at the highest postshock velocities and hence are preferentially shattered into the smallest fragments. Large grains are lost from the interstellar grain size distribution on time scales less than 108 yr in the warm medium. For 50 km s-1 {$\leq$} vs {$\leq$} 200 km s-1 as much as 5\%-15\% of the initial grain mass (all grain radii {$\geq$} 50 \AA ) may end up in sub-14 \AA{} fragments. Thus, interstellar shocks may be a prodigious source of PAH molecules, PAH clusters, and small grains. Given that the typical stardust injection time scale is 2.5 x 109 yr, we conclude that efficient mechanisms for grain growth, and in particular, the reformation of grains with radii{$>$} 1000 \AA, must exist in interstellar medium in order that the refractory elements be incorporated in dust and that most of the dust mass is in sizes {$\geq$} 1000 \AA, as observed.},

We compare our results with the approximations and cross section used by other authors. We also discuss some simplifying limit cases, and we derive some simple approximation for the most probable scattering angle. We also provide cross sections for the production of electron positron pairs from energetic photons when they interact with air molecules. This process is related to the Bremsstrahlung process by some physical symmetry. Therefore the results above can be transferred to predictions on the angles between incident photon and emitted positron, again as a function of photon and positron energy. We present the distribution of angles and again a simple approximation for the most probable scattering angle.

  abstract = {In this paper, we show how the two-fluid equations describing the evolution of a dust and gas mixture can be re-formulated to describe a single fluid moving with the barycentric velocity of the mixture. This leads to evolution equations for the total density, momentum, the differential velocity between the dust and the gas phases and either the dust-to-gas ratio or the dust fraction. The equations are similar to the usual equations of gas dynamics, providing a convenient way to extend existing codes to simulate two-fluid mixtures without modifying the code architecture. Our approach avoids the inherent difficulties related to the standard approach where the two phases are separate and coupled via a drag term. In particular, the requirements of infinite spatial and temporal resolution as the stopping time tends to zero are no longer necessary. This means that both small and large grains can be straightforwardly treated with the same method, with no need for complicated implicit schemes. Since there is only one resolution scale the method also avoids the problem of unphysical trapping of one fluid (e.g. dust) below the resolution of the other. We also derive a simplified set of equations applicable to the case of strong drag/small grains, consisting of the standard fluid equations with a modified sound speed, plus an advection\textendash diffusion equation for the dust-to-gas ratio. This provides a simple and fast way to evolve the mixture when the stopping time is smaller than the Courant time step. We present a smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementation in a companion paper.},

The solutions provide a means of benchmarking numerical codes designed to simulate the non-linear dynamics of dusty gas. The first problem, DUSTYBOX, consists of two interpenetrating homogeneous fluids moving with relative velocity difference. We provide exact solutions to the full non-linear problem for a range of drag formulations appropriate to astrophysical fluids (i.e. various prescriptions for Epstein and Stokes drag in different regimes). The second problem, DUSTYWAVE, consists of the propagation of linear acoustic waves in a two-fluid gas\textendash dust mixture. We provide the analytic solution for the case when the two fluids are interacting via a linear drag term. Both test problems are simple to set up in any numerical code and can be run with periodic boundary conditions. The solutions we derive are completely general with respect to both the dust-to-gas ratio and the amplitude of the drag coefficient. A stability analysis of waves in a gas\textendash dust system is also presented, showing that sound waves in an astrophysical dust\textendash gas mixture are linearly stable.},

Aims: We study the structure and stability of the colliding wind region as it turns into a spiral owing to the orbital motion. We focus on adiabatic winds, where mixing between the two winds is expected to be restricted to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Mixing of the Wolf-Rayet wind with hydrogen-rich material is important for dust formation in pinwheel nebulae such as WR 104, where the spiral structure has been resolved in infrared.  Methods: We use the hydrodynamical code RAMSES to solve the equations of hydrodynamics on an adaptive grid. A wide range of binary systems with different wind velocities and mass-loss rates are studied with two-dimensional simulations. A specific three-dimensional simulation is performed to model WR 104. Results: Orbital motion leads to the formation of two distinct spiral arms where the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops differently. We find that the spiral structure is destroyed when there is a large velocity gradient between the winds, unless the collimated wind is much faster. We argue that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability plays a major role in determining whether the structure is maintained. We discuss the consequences for various colliding-wind binaries. When their spiral structure is stable, there is no straightforward relationship between the spatial step of the spiral, the wind velocities, and the orbital period. Our 3D simulation of WR 104 indicates that the colder, well-mixed trailing arm has more favourable conditions for dust formation than the leading arm. The single-arm infrared spiral follows more closely the mixing map than the density map, suggesting that the dust-to-gas ratio may vary between the leading and trailing density spirals. However, the density is much lower than what dust formation models require. Including radiative cooling would lead to higher densities, and also to thin shell instabilities whose impact on the large-scale structure remains unknown.

The durations of the different evolutionary stages of massive core helium burning stars, which may be defined in terms of their surface chemical composition, have been estimated. This could be done by relating the time evolution of the surface hydrogen mass fraction to the interior hydrogen profile of stars at He-ignition via their average rates of mass loss due to stellar wind. Several observational details can be explained in this way, especially the high mean mass of WNL stars and the low mean mass of WNE stars. Further it is suggested that very massive stars explode as WNL stars.},

A multi-epoch analysis of mid-IR photometry of WR?112 over the past ?20 years reveals no significant variability in the observed dust temperature and mass. The morphology of the mid-IR dust emission from WR?112 also exhibits no significant expansion from imaging data taken in 2001, 2007, and 2016, which disputes the current interpretation of the nebula as a high expansion velocity (?1200 km s ?1 ) ?pinwheel?-shaped outflow driven by the central WC?OB colliding-wind binary. An upper limit of ?120 km s ?1 is derived for the expansion velocity assuming a distance of 4.15?kpc. The upper limit on the average total mass-loss rate from the central 3? of WR?112 is estimated to be ?8???10 ?6 M ? ?year ?1 .

Optical follow-up spectroscopy of SPIRITS 16ln, 19q, 16df, 18hb, and 14apu reveals emission features from C iv {$\lambda$}5801-12 and/or the C iii\textendash iv {$\lambda$}4650/He ii {$\lambda$}4686 blend that are consistent with early-type WC stars. We identify SPIRITS 16ln as the variable mid-IR counterpart of the recently discovered colliding-wind WC4 + O binary candidate, N604-WRXc, located in the subsolar metallicity NGC 604 H ii region in M33. We interpret the mid-IR variability from SPIRITS 16ln as a dust-formation episode in an eccentric colliding-wind WC binary. SPIRITS 19q, 16df, 14apu, and 18hb exhibit absolute [3.6] magnitudes exceeding that of one of the most IR-luminous dust-forming WC systems known, WR 104 (M [3.6] {$\lessequivlnt$} -12.3). An analysis of dust formation in the mid-IR outburst from SPIRITS 19q reveals a high dust production rate of M {$\odot$} yr-1, which may therefore exceed that of the most efficient dust-forming WC systems known. We demonstrate that efficient dust formation is feasible from early-type WC binaries in the theoretical framework of colliding-wind binary dust formation if the systems host an O-type companion with high mass-loss rates ( M {$\odot$} yr-1). This efficient dust formation from early-type WC binaries highlights their potential role as significant sources of dust in low-metallicity environments.},

Both constant SF and coeval models indicate that SNe are net dust destroyers at all metallicities. Constant SF models at LMC-like metallicities show that AGB stars slightly outproduce WC binaries and RSGs by factors of 2\textendash 3, whereas at solar metallicities WC binaries are the dominant source of dust for {$\sim$}60 Myr until the onset of AGBs, which match the dust input of WC binaries.

We show that the ultraviolet resonance lines of ions such as Si iv, C iv, N v, and S vi can give strongly negative effective gravities in the outer parts of the reversing layers of hot stars. We argue that a static reversing layer is then no longer possible and that a continuous outflow of mass occurs. To calculate rates of mass loss resulting from this mechanism, we formulate the problem of steady-state, moving reversing layers. From numerical solutions of the equations of this problem, the rate of mass loss is found to be {$<$} L/c2\textbackslash{} the evolution of the star is therefore not disturbed significantly. The domain in the (log Teiii log g)-plane where the greatest rates of mass loss are expected is also approximately determined and found to be roughly consistent with observation. Finally, the problem of the supersonic flow to large distances from the star is briefly discussed.},

The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing toward detailed spectroscopic observations to characterize the atmospheres of these planets. Various surveys from space and the ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars that make the planets conducive for atmospheric characterization. The current state of this frontier of exoplanetary atmospheres may be summarized as follows. {$\blacksquare$} We have entered the era of comparative exoplanetology thanks to high-fidelity atmospheric observations now available for tens of exoplanets. {$\blacksquare$} Recent studies reveal a rich diversity of chemical compositions and atmospheric processes hitherto unseen in the Solar System. {$\blacksquare$} Elemental abundances of exoplanetary atmospheres place important constraints on exoplanetary formation and migration histories. {$\blacksquare$} Upcoming observational facilities promise to revolutionize exoplanetary spectroscopy down to rocky exoplanets. {$\blacksquare$} The detection of a biosignature in an exoplanetary atmosphere is conceivable over the next decade. In the present review, we discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observationalmethods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state of the art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area.},

Here we report the discovery of a relatively cool, extended, multi-arc dust envelope around the star WR112, most likely formed by wind-wind collision in a long-period binary system. We derive the binary orbital parameters, the dust temperature and the dust mass distributions in the envelope. We find that amorphous carbon is a main constituent of the dust, in agreement with earlier estimates and theoretical predictions. However, the characteristic size of the dust grains is estimated to be {$\sim$} 1\textmu m, significantly larger than theoretical limits. The dust production rate is 6.1 \texttimes{} 10-7M{$\odot$}yr-1 and the total detectable dust mass is found to be about 2.8 \texttimes{} 10-5M{$\odot$} (for d = 4.15 kpc).

The broad emission complexes around {$\sim$}6.5, 8.0 and 8.8 \textmu m could arise from ionized, small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) clusters and/or amorphous carbonaceous grains. As such these PAH emissions may represent the long sought after precursors of amorphous Carbon dust. We also detect a strong {$\sim$}10.0 \textmu m emission in the spectra of WR48a and WR112, that we tentatively link to ionized PAHs. Upon examining the available archival spectra of prodigious individual WR dust sources, we notice a surprising lack of 7.7 \textmu m PAH band in the spectrum of the binary WR19, in contrast to the apparent strength of the 11.2, 12.7 and 16.4 \textmu m PAH features. Strong PAH emissions are also detected in the {$\lambda$} {$>$}10 \textmu m spectrum of another dust-producing system, WR118, pointing to the presence of large, neutral, presumably interstellar PAH molecules towards WR19 and WR118.},

Mid-infrared imaging revealed a giant spiral dust plume that is reminiscent of a pinwheel nebula but with additional features that suggest Apep is a unique system. We have conducted observations with the Australian Long Baseline Array to resolve Apep's radio emission on milliarcsecond scales, allowing us to relate the geometry of the wind-collision region to that of the spiral plume. The observed radio emission shows a bow-shaped structure, confirming its origin as a wind-collision region. The shape and orientation of this region is consistent with being originated by the two stars and with being likely dominated by the stronger wind of the WN4\textendash 6b star. This shape allowed us to provide a rough estimation of the opening angle of {$\sim$}150{$\bigcirc$} assuming ideal conditions. The orientation and opening angle of the emission also confirms it as the basis for the spiral dust plume. We also provide estimations for the two stars in the system to milliarcsecond precision. The observed radio emission, one order of magnitude brighter and more luminous than any other known non-thermal radio-emitting CWB, confirms it is produced by an extremely powerful wind collision. Such a powerful wind-collision region is consistent with Apep being a binary composed of two WR stars, so far the first unambiguously confirmed system of its kind.},

Recent observations have indicated that hydrogen-free WR stars have cooler temperatures than those predicted by current evolutionary models. To investigate how varying mass-loss rate affects WR evolution, we have created a grid of pure helium star models. We compare our results with Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud WR observations and show that the temperature ranges of observed WR stars can be reproduced by varying the mass-loss rate, which effectively determines the size of the helium envelope around the core. We also find that WN and WO stars arise from more massive stars, whereas WC stars come from lower masses. This contradicts the standard Conti scenario by which WN and WC stars evolve in an age sequence. We also predict the magnitudes of our models at core-collapse and compare with observations of nearby progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae. We confirm the findings of previous studies that suggest WR stars are the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae; the progenitors would remain unobserved except in the cases where the progenitor is a low-mass helium giant, as is the case of iPTF13bvn.},

  abstract = {Parabolic partial differential equations appear in several physical problems, including problems that have a dominant hyperbolic part coupled to a sub-dominant parabolic component. Explicit methods for their solution are easy to implement but have very restrictive time step constraints. Implicit solution methods can be unconditionally stable but have the disadvantage of being computationally costly or difficult to implement. Super-time-stepping methods for treating parabolic terms in mixed type partial differential equations occupy an intermediate position. In such methods each superstep takes ``s'' explicit Runge-Kutta-like time-steps to advance the parabolic terms by a time-step that is s2 times larger than a single explicit time-step. The expanded stability is usually obtained by mapping the short recursion relation of the explicit Runge-Kutta scheme to the recursion relation of some well-known, stable polynomial. Prior work has built temporally first- and second-order accurate super-time-stepping methods around the recursion relation associated with Chebyshev polynomials. Since their stability is based on the boundedness of the Chebyshev polynomials, these methods have been called RKC1 and RKC2. In this work we build temporally first- and second-order accurate super-time-stepping methods around the recursion relation associated with Legendre polynomials. We call these methods RKL1 and RKL2. The RKL1 method is first-order accurate in time; the RKL2 method is second-order accurate in time. We verify that the newly-designed RKL1 and RKL2 schemes have a very desirable monotonicity preserving property for one-dimensional problems - a solution that is monotone at the beginning of a time step retains that property at the end of that time step. It is shown that RKL1 and RKL2 methods are stable for all values of the diffusion coefficient up to the maximum value. We call this a convex monotonicity preserving property and show by examples that it is very useful in parabolic problems with variable diffusion coefficients. This includes variable coefficient parabolic equations that might give rise to skew symmetric terms. The RKC1 and RKC2 schemes do not share this convex monotonicity preserving property. One-dimensional and two-dimensional von Neumann stability analyses of RKC1, RKC2, RKL1 and RKL2 are also presented, showing that the latter two have some advantages. The paper includes several details to facilitate implementation. A detailed accuracy analysis is presented to show that the methods reach their design accuracies. A stringent set of test problems is also presented. To demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our methods, we show their successful operation on problems involving linear and non-linear heat conduction and viscosity, resistive magnetohydrodynamics, ambipolar diffusion dominated magnetohydrodynamics, level set methods and flux limited radiation diffusion. In a prior paper (Meyer, Balsara and Aslam 2012 [36]) we have also presented an extensive test-suite showing that the RKL2 method works robustly in the presence of shocks in an anisotropically conducting, magnetized plasma.},

  abstract = {Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent one of the final stages of massive stellar evolution. Relatively little is known about this short-lived phase and we currently lack reliable mass, distance, and binarity determinations for a representative sample. Here we report the first visual orbit for WR 140 (= HD193793), a WC7+O5 binary system known for its periodic dust production episodes triggered by intense colliding winds near periastron passage. The Infrared-Optical Telescope Array and Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometers resolved the pair of stars in each year from 2003 to 2009, covering most of the highly eccentric, 7.9 year orbit. Combining our results with the recently improved double-line spectroscopic orbit of Fahed et al., we find the WR 140 system is located at a distance of 1.67 {$\pm$} 0.03 kpc, composed of a WR star with M WR = 14.9 {$\pm$} 0.5 M {$\odot$} and an O star with M O = 35.9 {$\pm$} 1.3 M {$\odot$}. Our precision orbit yields key parameters with uncertainties \textasciitilde 6\texttimes{} smaller than previous work and paves the way for detailed modeling of the system. Our newly measured flux ratios at the near-infrared H and Ks bands allow a spectral energy distribution decomposition and analysis of the component evolutionary states.},

  abstract = {Surface sputtering by solar-wind ion irradiation of airless planetary  bodies is important for understanding the body's surface and exospheric compositions. Laboratory simulations are both complex and expensive. Hence, theoretical sputtering models are used to describe the behavior of the incoming ions, impacted surface, and sputtered atoms. Results from these models provide inputs for exospheric models. The most common sputter models use the binary collision approximation (BCA), such as SDTrim.SP. While these models are typically accurate for high impact energies, the approximations can potentially introduce error for low energy impacts or crystalline targets. In contrast, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations remove the BCA approximation and are able to simulate the entire collision cascade, albeit at a high computational cost. MD simulations also allow one to control the properties of the initial substrate, including crystalline structure, temperature, crystal damage, and roughness. However, MD simulations can require several user specific choices, such as interatomic potential, that can affect accuracy. Before either BCA or MD models can be confidently used to simulate planetary surface ion impacts, it is important to verify their ranges of applicability and limitations by comparison to pre-existing experimental values. Specifically, we consider a copper substrate impacted by argon ions with kinetic energies between 200-1000 eV and compare the SDTrim.SP and MD results to the experimental values for the resulting sputtering yield and energy distributions. In addition, we compare results with the commonly used Thompson model for the energy distributions. Overall, our findings highlight the potential advantages for MD simulations when specific substrate and simulation parameters are desired.}

  abstract = {Context. Mass loss from massive stars forms an important aspect of the evolution of massive stars, as well as for the enrichment of the surrounding interstellar medium. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Our goal is to predict accurate mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities. These quantities can be compared to empirical values, thereby testing radiation-driven wind models. One specific topical issue is that of the so-called "weak-wind problem", where empirically derived mass-loss rates and (modified) wind momenta fall orders of magnitude short of predicted values. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We employ an established Monte Carlo model and a recently suggested new line acceleration formalism to solve the wind dynamics more consistently. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We provide a new grid of mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of O-type stars, and compare the values to empirical results. Our models fail to provide mass-loss rates for main-sequence stars below a luminosity of log(L/L\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}) = 5.2, where we appear to run into a fundamental limit. At luminosities below this critical value there is insufficient momentum transferred to the wind in the region below the sonic point in order to kick-start the acceleration of the flow. This problem occurs at almost the exact location of the onset of the weak-wind problem. For O dwarfs, the boundary between being able to start a wind, and failing to do so, is at spectral type O6/O6.5. The direct cause of this failure for O6.5 stars is a combination of the lower luminosity and a lack of Fe v lines at the base of the wind. This might indicate that - in addition to radiation pressure - another mechanism is required to provide the necessary driving to initiate the wind acceleration. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: For stars more luminous than 10\textsuperscript{5.2} L\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, our new mass-loss rates are in excellent agreement with the mass-loss prescription by Vink et al. (2000, A\&amp;A, 362, 295) using our terminal wind velocities as input to this recipe. This implies that the main assumption entering the method of the Vink et al. prescriptions - i.e. that the momentum equation is not explicitly solved for - does not compromise the reliability of the Vink et al. results for this part of parameter space. Finally, our new models predict terminal velocities that are typically 35 and 45 percent larger than observed values. Such over-predictions are similar to those from (modified) CAK-theory.},

Dynamical models suggest that icy bodies in the main cometary reservoirs (Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud) formed in a range of environments in the protoplanetary disk, and (for the Oort Cloud) even in disks surrounding neighboring stars of the Sun's birth cluster. Photometric and spectroscopic surveys of more than 100 comets have enabled taxonomic groupings based on free radical species and on crystallinity of rocky grains. Since 1985, new surveys have provided emerging taxonomies based on the abundance ratios of primary volatiles. More than 20 primary chemical species are now detected in bright comets. Measurements of nuclear spin ratios (in water, ammonia, and methane) and of isotopic ratios (D/H in water and HCN; 14N/15N in CN and HCN) have provided critical insights on factors affecting formation of the primary species. The identification of an abundant product species (HNC) has provided clear evidence of chemical production in the inner coma. Parallel advances have occurred in astrochemistry of hot corinos, circumstellar disks, and dense cloud cores. In this review, we address the current state of cometary taxonomy and compare it with current astrochemical insights.},

  abstract = {We present DART-RAY, a new ray-tracing 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) code designed specifically to calculate radiation field energy density (RFED) distributions within dusty galaxy models with arbitrary geometries. In this paper we introduce the basic algorithm implemented in DART-RAY which is based on a pre-calculation of a lower limit for the RFED distribution. This pre-calculation allows us to estimate the extent of regions around the radiation sources within which these sources contribute significantly to the RFED. In this way, ray-tracing calculations can be restricted to take place only within these regions, thus substantially reducing the computational time compared to a complete ray-tracing RT calculation. Anisotropic scattering is included in the code and handled in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the code utilizes a Cartesian adaptive spatial grid and an iterative method has been implemented to optimize the angular densities of the rays originated from each emitting cell. In order to verify the accuracy of the RT calculations performed by DART-RAY, we present results of comparisons with solutions obtained using the DUSTY 1D RT code for a dust shell illuminated by a central point source and existing 2D RT calculations of disc galaxies with diffusely distributed stellar emission and dust opacity. Finally, we show the application of the code on a spiral galaxy model with logarithmic spiral arms in order to measure the effect of the spiral pattern on the attenuation and RFED.},

While its light curve had remained unchanged between 2000 and 2005, the X-ray flux has now increased by a factor of {$\sim$}2.5, and slightly hardened. The new observations also extend the observational coverage over the entire orbit, pinpointing the light-curve shape. It has not varied much despite the large overall brightening, and a tight correlation of fluxes with orbital separation is found without any hysteresis effect. Moreover, the absence of eclipses and of absorption effects related to orientation suggests a large size for the X-ray emitting region. Simple analytical models of the wind\textendash wind collision, considering the varying wind properties of the eruptive component in HD 5980, are able to reproduce the recent hardening and the flux-separation relationship, at least qualitatively, but they predict a hardening at apastron and little change in mean flux, contrary to observations. The brightness change could then possibly be related to a recently theorized phenomenon linked to the varying strength of thin-shell instabilities in shocked wind regions.},

Using an escape probability method to solve for the molecular level populations, we have obtained the cooling rate for each molecule as a function of temperature, density, and an optical depth parameter. A four-parameter expression proves useful in fitting the run of cooling rate with density for any fixed values of the temperature and optical depth parameter. We identify the various cooling mechanisms which are dominant in different regions of the astrophysically relevant parameter space. Given the assumption that water is very abundant in warm regions of the interstellar medium, H2O rotational transitions are found to dominate the cooling of warm interstellar gas over a wide portion of the parameter space considered. While chemical models for the interstellar medium make the strong prediction that water will be produced copiously at temperatures above a few hundred degrees, our assumption of a high water abundance has yet to be tested observationally. The Infrared Space Observatory and the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite will prove ideal instruments for testing whether water is indeed an important coolant of interstellar and circumstellar gas.},

The high resolution data on 59 WR stars (39 from the Galaxy and 20 from LMC) were used to calibrate the empirical relation lambda\_min\^Abs- lambda\_peak\^Emis vs terminal wind velocity, which was then used for determinations of the terminal wind velocities from the low resolution IUE data. We almost doubled the previous most extended sample of such measurements. Our new measurements, based on high resolution data, are precise within 5-7\%. Measurements, based on the low resolution spectra have the formal errors of approx 40-60\%. A comparison of the present results with other determinations suggests higher precision of approx 20\%. We found that the terminal wind velocities for the Galactic WC and WN stars correlate with the WR spectral subtype. We also found that the LMC WN stars have winds slower than their Galactic counterparts, up to two times in the case of the WNE stars. No influence of binarity on terminal wind velocities was found. Our extended set of measurements allowed us to test application of the radiation driven wind theory to the WR stars. We found that, contrary to OB stars, terminal wind velocities of the WR stars correlate only weakly with stellar temperature. We also note that the terminal to escape velocity ratio for the WR stars is relatively low: 2.55 pm 1.14 for the Galactic WN stars and 1.78 pm 0.70 for the Galactic WCs. This ratio decreases with temperature of WR stars, contrary to what is observed in the case of OB stars. The presented results show complex influence of chemical composition on the WR winds driving mechanism efficiency. Our kinematical data on WR winds suggest evolutionary sequence: WNL --{$>$} WNE --{$>$} WCE --{$>$} WCL.},

Optical spectroscopy confirms the classification of the companion as a B0 supergiant and suggests that the Balmer lines in its spectrum suffer in-fill from wind emission. Re-examination of the reddening suggests a revised distance of 3.5 kpc. In the near-IR, the amplitude of variation increases with wavelength, with no significant variation in J (nor is there in the visible), implying that it is the amount of dust in the wind of WR 70 that is varying. Period searches show a period near 2.82 yr (1030 d) but the variations are not strictly regular and there are other factors affecting the dust formation and repeatability of the light curves. There may be a secondary period near 5.88 yr but there is no evidence for periods less than a year. A model of the spectral energy distribution in 1991 gives a dust formation rate of 5.9 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-7} M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} yr\textsuperscript{-1}, around one-third of the available carbon from the WC9 wind going into the wind-collision region, estimating its size from average WC9 and B0Ia wind properties. The fraction of carbon going into dust varied between \texttildelow 11 and 46 per cent during our campaign, possibly as a consequence of the stars moving in an elliptical orbit.},

  abstract = {I review driving mechanisms for stellar winds, using first the example of the coronal, pressure-driven solar wind, but then focussing mainly on radiation-pressure driven winds from hot, luminous stars. For the latter, I review the central role of line-opacity as a coupling between matter and radiation, emphasizing how the Doppler shift of an accelerating wind outflow exposes the strong line opacity to a substantial continuum flux, and thus allows the line force to sustain the outward acceleration against gravity. Through the CAK formalism that assumes a power-law distribution of line-opacity, I derive the mass loss rate and wind velocity law, and discuss how these are altered by various refinements like a finite-disk correction, ionization variations in opacity, and a non-zero sound speed. I also discuss how multiline scattering in Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds can allow them to exceed the single scattering limit, for which the wind and radiative momenta are equal. Through a time-dependent perturbation analysis, I show how the line-driving leads to a fast, inward ``Abbott-wave'' mode for long wavelength perturbations, and a strong Line-Deshadowing-Instability at short wavelengths, summarizing also 1D and 2D numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of this instability. I next discuss how rapid stellar rotation alters the latitudinal variation of mass loss and flow speed, and how this depends on treatment of gravity darkening, nonradial line forces, and ``bi-stability'' shifts in ionization. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of the large mass loss epochs of Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and how these might be modeled via superEddington, continuum driving moderated by the ``porosity'' associated with extensive spatial structure.},

A key advantage of this approach over grid or smoothed particle hydrodynamic models is its significantly reduced computational cost, while it also allows the study of the structure obtained in an eccentric orbit.

  abstract = {Methods. Three dimensional (3D) adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) simulations are presented that include radiative driving, gravity, optically-thin radiative cooling, and orbital motion. Simulations were performed with instantaneously accelerated and radiatively driven stellar winds. Radiative transfer calculations were performed on the simulation output to generate synthetic X-ray data, which are used to conduct a detailed comparison against observations. Results. When instantaneously accelerated stellar winds are adopted in the simulation, a stable wind-wind collision region (WCR) is established at all orbital phases. In contrast, when the stellar winds are radiatively driven, and thus the acceleration regions of the winds are accounted for, the WCR is far more unstable. As the stars approach periastron, the ram pressure of the WR's wind overwhelms the O star's and, following a significant disruption of the shocks by non-linear thin-shell instabilities (NTSIs), the WCR collapses onto the O star. X-ray calculations reveal that when a stable WCR exists the models over-predict the observed X-ray flux by more than two orders of magnitude. The collapse of the WCR onto the O star substantially reduces the discrepancy in the 2\textendash 10 keV flux to a factor of 6 at {$\varphi$} = 0.994. However, the observed spectrum is not well matched by the models. Conclusions. We conclude that the agreement between the models and observations could be improved by increasing the ratio of the mass-loss rates in favour of the WR star to the extent that a normal wind ram pressure balance does not occur at any orbital phase, potentially leading to a sustained collapse of the WCR onto the O star. Radiative braking may then play a significant r\^ole for the WCR dynamics and resulting X-ray emission.},

The first eleven chapters cover all the basic ideas of fluid mechanics, explaining carefully the modelling and mathematics needed. The last six chapters illustrate applications of this material to linearised sound and water waves, to high speed flow of air, to non-linear water waves on channels, and to aerofoil theory. Over 350 diagrams have been used to illustrate key points. Exercises are included to help develop and reinforce the reader's understanding of the material presented. References at the ends of each chapter serve not only to guide readers to more detailed texts, but also list where alternative descriptions of the salient points in the chapter may be found.

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

Estimated water vapor in the upper atmosphere was then introduced in the initial conditions for the WACCM simulations that modeled the subsequent perturbation of atmospheric chemistry Final estimates of the change over time in UV flux at the surface due to the impact-induced ozone change are then carried out using the TUV radiative transfer model. The results suggest that mid-latitude oceanic impacts of 1km asteroids can produce a significant, global perturbation of upper atmospheric chemistry, including multi-year global ozone depletion comparable to ozone hole records registered in the mid-1990s. Asteroids 500m in diameter cause limited perturbations of upper atmospheric chemistry with significant ozone depletion confined to the hemisphere in which the impact occurred. Impact-induced ozone depletion affects UV irradiance at the Earth's surface, resulting in levels of UV-B irradiance that can be dangerous for living organisms, and, in the tropics and initial midlatitude summers, far exceed levels currently experienced anywhere on Earth.},

In this first paper, we restrict our study to main-sequence O+O binaries. The nature of the wind\textendash wind collision region is highly dependent on the degree of cooling of the shocked plasma, and the ratio of the flow time-scale of the shocked plasma to the orbital time-scale. The pre-shock wind speeds are lower in close systems as the winds collide prior to their acceleration to terminal speeds. Radiative inhibition may also reduce the pre-shock wind speeds. Together, these effects can lead to rapid cooling of the post-shock gas. Radiative inhibition is less important in wider systems, where the winds are accelerated to higher speeds before they collide, and the resulting collision region can be largely adiabatic. In systems with eccentric orbits, cold gas formed during periastron passage can persist even at apastron, before being ablated and mixed into its surroundings and/or accelerated out of the system.},

The calculations are based on 3D hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds, orbital motion of the stars and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. The thermal emission arises from the stellar winds and the region where they collide. We investigate the flux and spectrum from a variety of models as a function of orbital phase and orientation of the observer, and compare to the single star case. The emission from the wind\textendash wind collision region (WCR) is strongly dependent on its density and temperature, being optically thick in radiative systems and optically thin in adiabatic systems. The flux from systems where the WCR is highly radiative, as investigated for the first time in this paper, can be over an order of magnitude greater than the combined flux from identically typed single stars. This excess occurs over a broad range of wavelengths from cm to submm. In contrast, when the WCR is largely adiabatic, a significant excess in the thermal flux occurs only below 100 GHz.},

We highlight recent developments in terms of physics modules such as hydrodynamics with dust coupling and the conservative implementation of Hall magnetohydrodynamics. A simple conservative high-order finite difference scheme that works in combination with all available physics modules is introduced and demonstrated at the example of monotonicity preserving fifth order reconstruction. Strong stability preserving high order Runge-Kutta time steppers are used to obtain stable evolutions in multi-dimensional applications realizing up to fourth order accuracy in space and time. With the new distinction between active and passive grid cells, MPI-AMRVAC is ideally suited to simulate evolutions where parts of the solution are controlled analytically, or have a tendency to progress into or out of a stationary state. Typical test problems and representative applications are discussed, with an outlook to follow-up research. Finally, we discuss the parallel scaling of the code and demonstrate excellent weak scaling up to 30 000 processors allowing to exploit modern peta-scale infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Mass loss is a key process in the evolution of massive stars, and must be understood quantitatively if it is to be successfully included in broader astrophysical applications such as galactic and cosmic evolution and ionization. In this review, we discuss various aspects of radiation driven mass loss, both from the theoretical and the observational side. We focus on developments in the past decade, concentrating on the winds from OB-stars, with some excursions to the winds from Luminous Blue Variables (including super-Eddington, continuum-driven winds), winds from Wolf\textendash Rayet stars, A-supergiants and Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae. After recapitulating the 1-D, stationary standard model of line-driven winds, extensions accounting for rotation and magnetic fields are discussed. Stationary wind models are presented that provide theoretical predictions for the mass-loss rates as a function of spectral type, metallicity, and the proximity to the Eddington limit. The relevance of the so-called bi-stability jump is outlined. We summarize diagnostical methods to infer wind properties from observations, and compare the results from corresponding campaigns (including the VLT-flames survey of massive stars) with theoretical predictions, featuring the mass loss-metallicity dependence. Subsequently, we concentrate on two urgent problems, weak winds and wind-clumping, that have been identified from various diagnostics and that challenge our present understanding of radiation driven winds. We discuss the problems of ``measuring'' mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of the NIR Br{$\alpha$}-line as a tool to enable a more precise quantification, and comment on physical explanations for mass-loss rates that are much lower than predicted by the standard model. Wind-clumping, conventionally interpreted as the consequence of a strong instability inherent to radiative line-driving, has severe implications for the interpretation of observational diagnostics, since derived mass-loss rates are usually overestimated when clumping is present but ignored in the analyses. Depending on the specific diagnostics, such overestimates can amount to factors of 2 to 10, and we describe ongoing attempts to allow for more uniform results. We point out that independent arguments from stellar evolution favor a moderate reduction of present-day mass-loss rates. We also consider larger scale wind structure, interpreted in terms of co-rotating interacting regions, and complete this review with a discussion of recent progress on the X-ray line emission from massive stars. Such emission is thought to originate both from magnetically confined winds and from non-magnetic winds, in the latter case related to the line-driven instability and/or clump-clump collisions. We highlight as to how far the analysis of such X-ray line emission can give further clues regarding an adequate description of wind clumping.},

Hyperion is parallelized, and is shown to scale well to thousands of processes. Two common benchmark models for protoplanetary disks were computed, and the results are found to be in excellent agreement with those from other codes. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of the code, dust temperatures, SEDs, and synthetic multi-wavelength images were computed for a dynamical simulation of a low-mass star formation region.

We have detected signs of a radio continuum pinwheel associated with WR 147, a nitrogen-rich WR star with spectral subtype WN8. These structures are known to exist around a handful of late-type carbon-rich WR stars with massive companions where dust has formed in the zone where the two winds collide and produced a plume of dense gas and dust that is carried out with the WR wind. As the binary system rotates, an Archimedean spiral detectable in the infrared is formed. The resulting pinwheel contains information on wind speeds, wind-momentum ratio, and orbital parameters. However, WR 147 is a WN star and the formation of dust is unlikely, so a different emission mechanism must be at work. Our analysis of the data suggests that in this case the emission is dominantly of a nonthermal nature (synchrotron), although we cannot exclude the possibility that some clumps could be brighter in free\textendash free emission. It is possible that the pinwheels associated with WN stars will be detectable only as nonthermal emitters at radio wavelengths. From the characteristics of the pinwheel we estimate a period of 1.7 yr for the binary system (the WN8 star and a companion yet undetected directly) that is responsible for the pinwheel.},

As anticipated, WR stars generally lie in the thin disc ({$\sim$}40\,pc half-width at half-maximum) between Galactocentric radii 3.5\textendash 10\,kpc, in accordance with other star formation tracers. We highlight 12 WR stars located at vertical distances of~{$\geq$}300\,pc from the mid-plane. Analysis of the radial variation in WR subtypes exposes a ubiquitously higher NWC/NWN ratio than predicted by stellar evolutionary models accounting for stellar rotation. Models for non-rotating stars or accounting for close binary evolution are more consistent with observations. We consolidate information acquired about the known WR content of the Milky Way to build a simple model of the complete population. We derive observable quantities over a range of wavelengths, allowing us to estimate a total number of 1900\,~{$\pm~$}\,250 Galactic WR stars, implying an average duration of~{$\sim$}\,0.4\,Myr for the WR phase at the current Milky Way star formation rate. Of relevance to future spectroscopic surveys, we use this model WR population to predict follow-up spectroscopy to KS\, {$\simeq$} \,17.5~mag will be necessary to identify 95\,per\,cent of Galactic WR stars. We anticipate that ESA's Gaia mission will make few additional WR star discoveries via low-resolution spectroscopy, though will significantly refine existing distance determinations.

  abstract = {Strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) methods are a specific type of time discretization method that have been widely used for the time evolution of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Under a suitable stepsize restriction, these methods share a desirable nonlinear stability property with the underlying PDE, e.g., stability with respect to total variation, the maximum norm, or other convex functional. This is of particular interest when the solution exhibits shock-like or other nonsmooth behavior. Many results are known for SSPRK methods with nonnegative coefficients. However, it has recently been shown that such methods cannot exist with order greater than 4. In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of explicit SSPRK methods with general (i.e., possibly negative) coefficients up to order 5. In particular, we show how to optimally treat negative coefficients (corresponding to a change in the upwind direction of the spatial discretization) in the context of effective CFL coefficient maximization and provide proofs of optimality of some explicit SSPRK methods of orders 1 to 4. We also give the first known explicit fifth-order SSPRK schemes and show their effectiveness in practice versus more well-known fifth-order explicit Runge-Kutta schemes.},

  abstract = {Wolf-Rayet stars of the carbon sequence (WC stars) are an important cornerstone in the late evolution of massive stars before their core collapse. As core-helium burning, hydrogen-free objects with huge mass-loss, they are likely the last observable stage before collapse and thus promising progenitor candidates for type Ib/c supernovae. Their strong mass-loss furthermore provides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds. Thus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for several astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first time parallaxes for a large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties inherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine a previously studied sample of WC stars to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All quantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral analyzes remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields that WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude. With Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex: We obtain luminosities ranging from logL/L\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} = 4.9-6.0 with one outlier (WR 119) having logL/L\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader initial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates ranging between log \.M = -5.1 and -4.1, with \.M {$\propto$} L\textsuperscript{0.68} and a linear scaling of the modified wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for stellar evolution, including unsolved issues regarding the need of envelope inflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions in regard to the connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts. WC and WO stars are progenitors of massive black holes, collapsing either silently or in a supernova that most-likely has to be preceded by a WO stage.},

The spectral energy distributions are also found to be like that of O stars in that they do not exhibit large attenuation of X-rays softer than 1 keV. This indicates that for both the O stars and WR stars much of the X-ray emission is coming from hot wisps or shocks in the outer regions of the winds and not from a thin source at the base of the wind.

While most models adjust their structure such that the local Eddington limit is exceeded at most by a few per cent, our most extreme models do so by a factor of more than seven. We find that the local violation of the Eddington limit has severe consequences for the envelope structure, as it leads to envelope inflation, convection, density inversions, and, possibly to, pulsations. We find that all models with luminosities higher than 4 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{5}L\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, i.e. stars above \textasciitilde 40 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} show inflation, with a radius increase of up to a factor of about 40. We find that the hot edge of the S Dor variability region coincides with a line beyond which our models are inflated by more than a factor of two, indicating a possible connection between S Dor variability and inflation. Furthermore, our coolest models show highly inflated envelopes with masses of up to several solar masses, and appear to be candidates for producing major luminous blue variable eruptions. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Our models show that the Eddington limit is expected to be reached in all stars above \textasciitilde 40 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} in the LMC, even in lower mass stars in the Galaxy, or in close binaries or rapid rotators. While our results do not support the idea of a direct super-Eddington wind driven by continuum photons, the consequences of the Eddington limit in the form of inflation, pulsations and possibly eruptions may well give rise to a significant enhancement of the time averaged mass-loss rate. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendices are available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525945/olm"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$}},

  abstract = {Determining the origin of volatiles on terrestrial planets and quantifying atmospheric loss during planet formation is crucial for understanding the history and evolution of planetary atmospheres. Using geochemical observations of noble gases and major volatiles we determine what the present day inventory of volatiles tells us about the sources, the accretion process and the early differentiation of the Earth. We further quantify the key volatile loss mechanisms and the atmospheric loss history during Earth's formation. Volatiles were accreted throughout the Earth's formation, but Earth's early accretion history was volatile poor. Although nebular Ne and possible H in the deep mantle might be a fingerprint of this early accretion, most of the mantle does not remember this signature implying that volatile loss occurred during accretion. Present day geochemistry of volatiles shows no evidence of hydrodynamic escape as the isotopic compositions of most volatiles are chondritic. This suggests that atmospheric loss generated by impacts played a major role during Earth's formation. While many of the volatiles have chondritic isotopic ratios, their relative abundances are certainly not chondritic again suggesting volatile loss tied to impacts. Geochemical evidence of atmospheric loss comes from the \$\{\}\^\{3\}\textbackslash mathrm\{He\}/\{\}\^\{22\}\textbackslash mathrm\{Ne\}\$, halogen ratios (e.g., F/Cl) and low H/N ratios. In addition, the geochemical ratios indicate that most of the water could have been delivered prior to the Moon forming impact and that the Moon forming impact did not drive off the ocean. Given the importance of impacts in determining the volatile budget of the Earth we examine the contributions to atmospheric loss from both small and large impacts. We find that atmospheric mass loss due to impacts can be characterized into three different regimes: 1) Giant Impacts, that create a strong shock transversing the whole planet and that can lead to atmospheric loss globally. 2) Large enough impactors (\$m\_\{\textbackslash mathit\{cap\}\} \textbackslash gtrsim \textbackslash sqrt\{2\} \textbackslash rho\_\{0\} (\textbackslash pi h R)\^\{3/2\}\$, \$r\_\{\textbackslash mathit\{cap\}\}\textbackslash sim25\textasciitilde\textbackslash mbox\{km\}\$for the current Earth), that are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, where \$h\$, \$R\$and \$\textbackslash rho\_\{0\}\$are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. 3) Small impactors (\$m\_\{\textbackslash mathit\{min\}\}{$>$}4 \textbackslash pi\textbackslash rho\_\{0\} h\^\{3\}\$, \$r\_\{\textbackslash mathit \{min\}\}\textbackslash sim 1\textasciitilde\textbackslash mbox\{km\}\$for the current Earth), that are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We demonstrate that per unit impactor mass, small impactors with \$r\_\{\textbackslash mathit\{min\}\} {$<$} r {$<$} r\_\{\textbackslash mathit\{cap\}\}\$are the most efficient impactors in eroding the atmosphere. In fact for the current atmospheric mass of the Earth, they are more than five orders of magnitude more efficient (per unit impactor mass) than giant impacts, implying that atmospheric mass loss must have been common. The enormous atmospheric mass loss efficiency of small impactors is due to the fact that most of their impact energy and momentum is directly available for local mass loss, where as in the giant impact regime a lot of energy and momentum is 'wasted' by having to create a strong shock that can transverse the entirety of the planet such that global atmospheric loss can be achieved. In the absence of any volatile delivery and outgassing, we show that the population of late impactors inferred from the lunar cratering record containing 0.1\%~\$M\_\{\textbackslash oplus \}\$is able to erode the entire current Earth's atmosphere implying that an interplay of erosion, outgassing and volatile delivery is likely responsible for determining the atmospheric mass and composition of the early Earth. Combining geochemical observations with impact models suggest an interesting synergy between small and big impacts, where giant impacts create large magma oceans and small and larger impacts drive the atmospheric loss.},

Contributions to the cooling rate by the individual elements are given, to allow for the creation of cooling curves tailored to specific abundance requirements. In some situations, it is important to be able to include radiative losses in the hydrodynamics. The enhanced compression ratio can trigger instabilities (such as the Vishniac thin-shell instability) that would otherwise be absent. For gas with temperatures below 104 K, the cooling time becomes very long and does not affect the gas on the timescales that are generally of interest for hydrodynamical simulations of circumstellar plasmas. However, above this temperature, a significant fraction of the elements is ionised, and the cooling rate increases by a factor 1000 relative to lower temperature plasmas.},

Disentanglement was performed using the code Spectangular or the shift-and-add algorithm. Evolutionary status was interpreted using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code, exploring binary interaction and chemically homogeneous evolution. Results. Among our sample, 28/44 objects show composite spectra and are analyzed as such. An additional five targets show periodically moving WR primaries but no detected companions (SB1); two (BAT99 99 and 112) are potential WR + compact-object candidates owing to their high X-ray luminosities. We cannot confirm the binary nature of the remaining 11 candidates. About two-thirds of the WN components in binaries are identified as cWR, and one-third as hydrogen-burning WR stars. We establish metallicity-dependent mass-loss recipes, which broadly agree with those recently derived for single WN stars, and in which so-called WN3/O3 stars are clear outliers. We estimate that 45 {$\pm$} 30\% of the cWR stars in our sample have interacted with a companion via mass transfer. However, only {$\approx$}12 {$\pm$} 7\% of the cWR stars in our sample naively appear to have formed purely owing to stripping via a companion (12\% b-WR). Assuming that apparently single WR stars truly formed as single stars, this comprises {$\approx$}4\% of the whole LMC WN population, which is about ten times less than expected. No obvious differences in the properties of single and binary WN stars, whose luminosities extend down to log L {$\approx$} 5.2 [L ], are apparent. With the exception of a few systems (BAT99 19, 49, and 103), the equatorial rotational velocities of the OB-type companions are moderate (veq 250 km s-1) and challenge standard formalisms of angular-momentum accretion. For most objects, chemically homogeneous evolution can be rejected for the secondary, but not for the WR progenitor. Conclusions. No obvious dichotomy in the locations of apparently single and binary WN stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is apparent. According to commonly used stellar evolution models (BPASS, Geneva), most apparently single WN stars could not have formed as single stars, implying that they were stripped by an undetected companion. Otherwise, it must follow that pre-WR mass-loss/mixing (e.g., during the red supergiant phase) are strongly underestimated in standard stellar evolution models.},

We introduce a relative intensity and transform the radiative transfer equation along the rays to solve machine precision problems and to relax strong gradients in the source term. For the optically thick regions where common ray tracers are forced to perform small trace steps, we give two criteria for making use of a simple approximative solver crossing the optically thick region quickly. Using an example of a density structure with optical depth changes of 6 orders of magnitude and sharp temperature variations, we demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme using a common fifth-order Runge-Kutta ray tracer with adaptive step-size control. In our test case, the gain in computational speed is about a factor of 870. The method is applied in order to calculate the temperature distribution within a massive molecular cloud core for different boundary conditions for the radiation field.},

Unfortunately, the 3D dust RT problem is nonlocal and nonlinear, which makes it one of the hardest challenges in computational astrophysics. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past decade, with an increasing number of codes capable of dealing with the complete 3D dust RT problem. We discuss the complexity of this problem, the two most successful solution techniques [ray-tracing (RayT) and Monte Carlo (MC)], and the state of the art in modeling observational data using 3D dust RT codes.

The program calculates the intensity emerging from these complicated structures using a combination of step-size controlled ray-tracing and adaptive multi-wavelength photon transport grids. Along with a 2nd order finite differencing approach, the grids are optimized to reduce the discretization error and provide global error control. The full wavelength-dependent problem is solved without any flux approximation, and for arbitrary scattering properties of the dust. The program is designed to provide spatially resolved images, visibilities, and spectra of complex dust distributions even without any symmetry for wavelengths ranging from the UV to FIR and allows for multiple internal and external sources. In this paper, the algorithm is described and the capabilities of the code are illustrated by the treatment of 1D and 3D test cases.

The X-ray luminosity and spectra of the shock-heated region, acounting for wind attenuation and the influence of different abundances on the resultant level and spectra of X-ray emission are calculated. A variety of dynamical instabilities that are found to dominate the intershock region is examined. These instabilities are found to be particularly important when postshock material is able to cool. These instabilities disrupt the postshock flow and add a time variability of order 10 percent to the X-ray luminosity. The X-ray spectrum of these systems is found to vary with the nuclear abundances of winds. These theoretical models are used to study several massive binary systems, in particular V444 Cyg and HD 193793.},

It is intended primarily for applications in astrophysical fluid dynamics, but its flexible and modular design enables its use for a wide variety of physics. The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a "task list" that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both non-relativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

They are now intermittently experiencing ionization-induced dynamical instability within their hydrogen-poor envelopes, while their massive helium cores are in an advanced stage of central helium burning. In the H-R diagram, our new evolutionary models successfully explain the high- and low- temperature limits, the low-luminosity limit, and the relative luminosity function of the observed LBVs at quiescence which have log (L/Lsun) {$<$} 6.3. Metal-poor LBVs are predicted (correctly, in the only case known) to be significantly cooler than LBVs with normal metallicities. In the (mass, luminosity) plane, the models and observed stars agree closely, and show no discernible metals dependence. Predicted values of the surface hydrogen abundance and of the expelled mass during the LBV phase match reasonably well the available observational data, which, however, are still very crude. The observed cycles of mass loss are predicted correctly. Pre-LBV and post-LBV stars can be identified with the hydrogen-poor and hydrogen-free WN stars, respectively. Post-red-supergiant lifetimes, derived from published star counts and kinematical ages of nebulae around the WN stars and LBVs, are used to infer an approximate mean value of the rate of stellar wind mass loss from luminous red supergiants. This parameter is crucial for understanding stellar evolution at log (L/Lsun) {$<$} 5.8. Stars more luminous may never become red, and may spend all, or nearly all, of their post-main-sequence lives as blue supergiants. Our theory of LBVs makes a number of other predictions that have not yet been tested. A critical comparison with the very different theory of Langer et al. is presented.},

  abstract = {Radiative shocks perturbed from steady state are subject to an oscillatory overstability. We have examined the nature of this overstability in one and two dimensions using numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We find that one-dimensional simulations of a uniform flow incident upon a reflecting wall produce oscillation frequencies in agreement with those of earlier analytic (Chevalier \& Imamura 1982) and numerical (Imamura, Wolff, \& Durisen 1984) work. We do not, however, find any evidence for positive growth rates. This result is not in contradiction with previous linear analysis because the supersonic flow into a wall problem is at a saturated, nonlinear amplitude from the beginning. In the case of one-dimensional steady state shocks in the absence of a solid wall, we find a slightly different dependence of the overstability on {$\alpha$} when we assume a cooling rate proportional to T{$\alpha$}. In this case oscillations in radiative shocks with {$\alpha$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.75 are found to saturate at a finite amplitude, i.e., the relevant critical value of alpha is at least above 0.5. We also find high Mach number systems to be less stable than low Mach number systems subject to the same cooling law. Simulations of two-dimensional steady state shocks reveal that transverse perturbations in the shock front quickly manifest themselves in the cold, dense gas layer downstream of the cooling region. Perturbations in the cold gas layer are dominated by spatial wavelengths, {$\lambda$} {$\lessequivlnt$} Lc, the cooling length of the shock. The action of this instability ensures that interstellar radiative shocks will not be smooth on length scales of order the local cooling length.},

The spectra changed in shape and flux with the phase. As periastron approached, the column density of the low-energy absorption increased, which indicates that the emission from the wind\textendash wind collision plasma was absorbed by the dense W\textendash R wind. The spectra can be mostly fitted with two different components: a warm component with kBT = 0.3\textendash 0.6~keV and a dominant hot component with kBT {$\sim$} 3~keV. The emission measure of the dominant, hot component is not inversely proportional to the distance between the two stars. This can be explained by the O star wind colliding before it has reached its terminal velocity, leading to a reduction in its wind momentum flux. At phases closer to periastron, we discovered a cool plasma component in a recombining phase, which is less absorbed. This component may be a relic of the wind\textendash wind collision plasma, which was cooled down by radiation, and may represent a transitional stage in dust formation.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical approach for accurately evolving a dust grain-size distribution undergoing number-conserving (such as sputtering) and/or mass-conserving (such as shattering) processes. As typically observed interstellar dust distributions follow a power law, our method adopts a power-law discretization and uses both the grain mass and number densities in each bin to determine the power-law parameters. This power-law method is complementary to piecewise-constant and linear methods in the literature. We find that the power-law method surpasses the other two approaches, especially for small bin numbers. In the sputtering tests, the relative error in the total grain mass remains below 0.01~per\,cent independent of the number of bins N, while the other methods only achieve this for N \&gt; 50 or higher. Likewise, the shattering test shows that the method also produces small relative errors in the total grain numbers while conserving mass. Not only does the power-law method conserve the global distribution properties, it also preserves the inter-bin characteristics so that the shape of the distribution is recovered to a high degree. This does not always happen for the constant and linear methods, especially not for small bin numbers. Implementing the power-law method in a hydrodynamical code thus minimizes the numerical cost while maintaining high accuracy. The method is not limited to dust grain distributions, but can also be applied to the evolution of any distribution function, such as a cosmic ray distribution affected by synchrotron radiation or inverse-Compton scattering.},

  abstract = {Following the observational and theoretical evidence that points at core collapse supernovae as major producers of dust, here we calculate the hydrodynamics of the matter reinserted within young and massive super stellar clusters under the assumption of gas and dust radiative cooling. The large supernova rate expected in massive clusters allows for a continuous replenishment of dust immersed in the high temperature thermalized reinserted matter and warrants a stationary presence of dust within the cluster volume during the type II supernova era. We first show that such a balance determines the range of dust to gas mass ratio and this the dust cooling law. We then search for the critical line that separates stationary cluster winds from the bimodal cases in the cluster mechanical luminosity (or cluster mass) vs cluster size parameter space. In the latter, strong radiative cooling reduces considerably the cluster wind mechanical energy output and affects particularly the cluster central regions, leading to frequent thermal instabilities that diminish the pressure and inhibit the exit of the reinserted matter. Instead matter accumulates there and is expected to eventually lead to gravitational instabilities and to further stellar formation with the matter reinserted by former massive stars. The main outcome of the calculations is that the critical line is almost two orders of magnitude or more, depending on the assumed value of VA{$\infty$}, lower than when only gas radiative cooling is applied. And thus, many massive clusters are predicted to enter the bimodal regime.},

  abstract = {To classify a book as 'experimental' rather than 'theoretical' or as 'pure' rather than 'applied' is liable to imply umeal distinctions. Nevertheless, some Classification is necessary to teIl the potential reader whether the book is for him. In this spirit, this book may be said to treat fluid dynamies as a branch of physics, rather than as a branch of applied mathematics or of engineering. I have often heard expressions of the need for such a book, and certainly I have feIt it in my own teaching. I have written it primariIy for students of physics and of physics-based applied science, aIthough I hope others may find it useful. The book differs from existing 'fundamental' books in placing much greater emphasis on what we know through laboratory experiments and their physical interpretation and less on the mathe matieal formalism. It differs from existing 'applied' books in that the choice of topics has been made for the insight they give into the behaviour of fluids in motion rather than for their practical importance. There are differences also from many existing books on fluid dynamics in the branches treated, reflecting to some extent shifts of interest in reeent years. In particular, geophysical and astrophysical applications have prompted important fundamental developments in topics such as conveetion, stratified flow, and the dynamics of rotating fluids. These developments have hitherto been reflected in the contents of textbooks only to a limited extent.},

  abstract = {Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are luminous massive blue stars thought to be immediate precursors to the supernova terminating their brief lives. The existence of dust shells around such stars has been enigmatic since their discovery some 30 years ago; the intense radiation field from the star should be inimical to dust survival. Although dust-creation models, including those involving interacting stellar winds from a companion star, have been put forward, high-resolution observations are required to understand this phenomena. Here we present resolved images of the dust outflow around Wolf-Rayet WR 104, obtained with novel imaging techniques, revealing detail on scales corresponding to about 40 AU at the star. Our maps show that the dust forms a spatially confined stream following precisely a linear (or Archimedian) spiral trajectory. Images taken at two separate epochs show a clear rotation with a period of 220 +/- 30 days. Taken together, these findings prove that a binary star is responsible for the creation of the circumstellar dust, while the spiral plume makes WR 104 the prototype of a new class of circumstellar nebulae unique to interacting wind systems.},

Encompassing 11 epochs in three near-infrared filter bandpasses, a homogeneous imaging data set spanning more than 6 years (or 10 orbits) is presented. Data were obtained from the highly successful Keck Aperture Masking Experiment, which can recover high fidelity images at extremely high angular resolutions, revealing the geometry of the plume with unprecedented precision. Inferred properties for the (unresolved) underlying binary and wind system are orbital period 241.5 +/- 0.5 days and angular outflow velocity of 0.28 +/- 0.02 mas/day. An optically thin cavity of angular size 13.3 +/- 1.4 mas was found to lie between the central binary and the onset of the spiral dust plume. Rotational motion of the wind system induced by the binary orbit is found to have important ramifications: entanglement of the winds results in strong shock activity far downstream from the nose of the bowshock. The far greater fraction of the winds participating in the collision may play a key role in gas compression and the nucleation of dust at large radii from the central binary and shock stagnation point. Investigation of the effects of radiative braking pointed towards significant modifications of the simple hydrostatic colliding wind geometry, extending the relevance of this phenomena to wider binary systems than previously considered. Limits placed on the maximum allowed orbital eccentricity of e {$<$} 0.06 argue strongly for a prehistory of tidal circularization in this system. Finally we discuss the implications of Earth's polar (i {$<$} 16 deg) vantage point onto a system likely to host supernova explosions at future epochs.},

  abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series ``Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.''},

We simulate the interaction of the mechanical energy input from 15, 40, 60 and 120 M stars into a 100 pc diameter 16 500 M cloud with a roughly spherical morphology with randomly distributed high-density condensations. The stellar winds are introduced using appropriate non-rotating Geneva stellar evolution models. In the 15 M star case, the wind has very little effect, spreading around a few neighbouring clumps before becoming overwhelmed by the cloud collapse. In contrast, in the 40, 60 and 120 M star cases, the more powerful stellar winds create large cavities and carve channels through the cloud, breaking out into the surrounding tenuous medium during the wind phase and considerably altering the cloud structure. After 4.97, 3.97 and 3.01 Myr, respectively, the massive stars explode as supernovae (SNe). The wind-sculpted surroundings considerably affect the evolution of these SN events as they both escape the cloud along wind-carved channels and sweep up remaining clumps of cloud/wind material. The `cloud' as a coherent structure does not survive the SN from any of these stars, but only in the 120 M case is the cold molecular material completely destabilized and returned to the unstable thermal phase. In the 40 and 60 M cases, coherent clumps of cold material are ejected from the cloud by the SN, potentially capable of further star formation.},

  title = {Hydrodynamical Modelling of Planetary Nebulae and Their Interaction with the Interstellar Medium},
  author = {Wareing, Christopher J.},
  year = {2005},
  address = {{England}},
  abstract = {In this thesis, a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program has been described, made parallel, tested and applied to astrophysical problems. The program, named CUBEMPI, was made parallel using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) library and examined via simple efficiency tests and more complex performance profilers within the Multi-Processing Environment (MPE) library of MPI. CUBEMPI was tested with various hydrodynamical problems, CUBEMPI successfully completed all tests and its performance was compared with that of several other CFD schemes. Comparing CUBEMPI with these other schemes, no one scheme performed consistently better than any of the others, CUBEMPI efficiently computes accurate solutions to the Euler equations and thus can be used to simulate fluid flow. CUBEMPI has been shown to be particularly capable of simulating shocks in astrophysical conditions and so was used to consider planetary nebulae (PNe) and their interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous modelling of PNe moving through the ISM has been performed in two dimensions (2D) following a detailed evolutionary track of the PN-forming star moving at a low speed. Here CUBEMPI has been used to simulate the interaction in three dimensions (3D) with a range of proper motions using a generic simple "triple-wind" model for the formation of PNe. This modelling has considered the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB stages of evolution and led to the conclusion that to understand the shape of a nebula inferred to be moving through the ISM, the AGB evolution must be considered as well as the post-AGB evolution as it has a strong shaping effect on the nebula. Signs of PN-ISM interaction are found not to be confined to ancient or extreme nebulae. In this thesis, simulated younger nebulae moving at low speeds show one-sided brightening and displacement of the central star from the geometric centre of the nebula. At higher speeds the nebulae are strongly affected and eventually no longer appear symmetric. The effect of ISM shaping on nebulae has been quantitatively shown in this thesis to be an explanation for the missing mass problem in PNe; much of the AGB material is swept downstream of the nebula. New observations of the crescent shaped nebula Sh 2-188 have been compared to the PN-ISM simulations and the nebula has been understood in terms of a PN moving at 125 kms[-1]. A proper motion study of the nebula has found it to be moving at 30 {$\pm$} 10 masyr[-1] in the direction of the bright crescent. The combination of these values has led to an estimate of the distance D = 850[+500-420] pc, diameter d \textasciitilde{} 2.5 pc and age t[PN] = 22,500 {$\pm$} 2,500 years. The triple-wind model explains the geometric displacement of the central star and the simulation estimates \textasciitilde{} 2/3 of the mass expected in the region of the star has been swept downstream. The nebula surrounding the classical nova GK Persei has also been investigated in terms of the triple-wind model using an asymmetric AGB wind. The model has produced a bipolar nebula of the shape observed around GK Per and high density equatorial regions which could account for the brightened emission in the southwest of the nova. Finally, improvements of CUBEMPI and the models are suggested.},

  abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics: An Introduction grew out of a von Karman Institute (VKI) Lecture Series by the same title ?rst presented in 1985 and repeated with modi?cations every year since that time. The objective, then and now, was to present the subject of computational ?uid dynamics (CFD) to an audience unfamiliar with all but the most basic numerical techniques and to do so in such a way that the practical application of CFD would become clear to everyone. A second edition appeared in 1995 with updates to all the chapters and when that printing came to an end, the publisher requested that the editor and authors consider the preparation of a third edition. Happily, the authors received the request with enthusiasm. The third edition has the goal of presenting additional updates and clari?cations while preserving the introductory nature of the material. The book is divided into three parts. John Anderson lays out the subject in Part I by ?rst describing the governing equations of ?uid dynamics, concentrating on their mathematical properties which contain the keys to the choice of the numerical approach. Methods of discretizing the equations are discussed and transformation techniques and grids are presented. Two examples of numerical methods close out this part of the book: source and vortex panel methods and the explicit method. Part II is devoted to four self-contained chapters on more advanced material. Roger Grundmann treats the boundary layer equations and methods of solution.},

For the additional heating to explain the discrepancy, it would have to have a weaker dependence on the gas density than the cooling rate, \textbackslash Lambda n\_e\^2. Reynolds et al. suggested turbulent dissipation or magnetic field reconnection as possible heating sources. We investigate here the viability of MHD-wave mediated cosmic ray heating as a supplemental heating source. This heating rate depends on the gas density only through its linear dependence on the Alfv\'en speed, which goes as n\_e\^\{-1/2\}. We show that, scaled to appropriate values of cosmic ray energy density, cosmic ray heating can be significant. Furthermore, this heating is stable to perturbations. These results should also apply to warm ionized gas in other galaxies.},

Frequent eclipses were observed from WR 104, and several from WR 106, extending the 1994\textendash 2001 studies by Kato et al., but not supporting their phasing the variations in WR 104 with its `pinwheel' rotation period. Only four other stars showed eclipses, WR 50 (one of the dust-free stars), WR 69, WR 95 and WR 117, and there may have been an eclipse by WR 121, which had shown two eclipses in the past. No dust eclipses were shown by the `historic' eclipsers WR 103 and WR 113. The atmospheric eclipses of the latter were observed but the suggestion by David-Uraz et al. that dust may be partly responsible for these is not supported. Despite its frequent eclipses, there is no evidence in the infrared images of WR 104 for dust made in its eclipses, demonstrating that any dust formed in this process is not a significant contributor to its circumstellar dust cloud and suggesting that the same applies to the other stars showing fewer eclipses.},

The images resolve the dust cloud formed by WR 140 in 2001, allowing us to track its expansion and cooling, while the photometry allows tracking the average temperature and total mass of the dust. The combination of the two data sets constrains the optical properties of the dust, and suggests that they differ from those of the dust made by the WC9 dust-makers, including the classical `pinwheel', WR 104. The photometry of individual dust emission features shows them to be significantly redder in (nbL \textendash [3.99]), but bluer in ([7.9]\textendash [12.5]), than the binary, as expected from the spectra of heated dust and the stellar wind of a Wolf\textendash Rayet star. The most persistent dust features, two concentrations at the ends of a `bar' of emission to the south of the star, were observed to move with constant proper motions of 324 {$\pm$} 8 and 243 {$\pm$} 7 mas yr-1. Longer wavelength (4.68 and 12.5 {$\mu$}m) images show dust emission from the corresponding features from the previous (1993) periastron passage and dust formation episode, showing that the dust expanded freely in a low-density void for over a decade, with dust features repeating from one cycle to the next. A third persistent dust concentration to the east of the binary (the `arm') was found to have a proper motion {$\sim$}320 mas yr-1, and a dust mass about one-quarter that of the `bar'. Extrapolation of the motions of the concentrations back to the binary suggests that the eastern `arm' began expansion four to five months earlier than those in the southern `bar', consistent with the projected rotation of the binary axis and wind-collision region (WCR) on the sky. A comparison of model dust images and the observations constrains the intervals when the WCR was producing sufficiently compressed wind for dust nucleation in the WCR, and suggests that the distribution of this material was not uniform about the axis of the WCR, but more abundant in the following edge in the orbital plane.},

Both absorption and emission components showed strong variations. The variation of the absorption component as the O5 star was occulted by the wind-collision region (WCR) sets a tight constraint on its geometry. While the sightline to the O5 star traversed the WCR, the strength and breadth of the absorption component varied significantly on time-scales of days. An emission subpeak was observed on all our profiles. The variation of its radial velocity with orbital phase was shown to be consistent with formation in the WCR as it swung round the stars in their orbit. Modelling the profile gives a measure of the extent of the subpeak-forming region. In the phase range 0.93\textendash 0.99, the flux in the subpeak increased steadily, approximately inversely proportionally to the stellar separation, indicating that the shocked gas in the WCR where the line was formed was adiabatic. After periastron, the subpeak flux was anomalously strong and varied rapidly, suggesting formation in clumps downstream in the WCR. For most of the time, its flux exceeded the 2\textendash 10-keV X-ray emission, showing it to be a significant coolant of the shocked wind.},

  abstract = {We present infrared (IR) photometry of the WC9+B0I Wolf\textendash Rayet binary system HD 137603 (WR 70) observed with telescopes at the European Southern Observatory, the South African Astronomical Observatory and the Anglo-Australian Telescope between 1983 and 2010 which shows persistent but variable circumstellar dust emission. Optical spectroscopy confirms the classification of the companion as a B0 supergiant and suggests that the Balmer lines in its spectrum suffer in-fill from wind emission. Re-examination of the reddening suggests a revised distance of 3.5 kpc. In the near-IR, the amplitude of variation increases with wavelength, with no significant variation in J (nor is there in the visible), implying that it is the amount of dust in the wind of WR 70 that is varying. Period searches show a period near 2.82 yr (1030 d) but the variations are not strictly regular and there are other factors affecting the dust formation and repeatability of the light curves. There may be a secondary period near 5.88 yr but there is no evidence for periods less than a year. A model of the spectral energy distribution in 1991 gives a dust formation rate of 5.9 \texttimes{} 10-7 M yr-1, around one-third of the available carbon from the WC9 wind going into the wind-collision region, estimating its size from average WC9 and B0Ia wind properties. The fraction of carbon going into dust varied between {$\sim$}11 and 46 per cent during our campaign, possibly as a consequence of the stars moving in an elliptical orbit.},

These included multi-site optical spectroscopy to refine the radial velocity orbit and study anomalous emission from the shock-compressed wind, infrared spectroscopy to study related features and map the wind-collision region, high-resolution radio imaging of the wind-collision shock, and X-ray observations with RXTE, XMMNewton, Chandra and Suzaku to study physical conditions in the shocks.

Comparison of spectra of WR 104 observed in 1995 and 1997 showed the absorption lines to be more conspicuous in the latter observation and the emission lines weaker, suggesting a selective eclipse of the WC9 star similar to that observed by Crowther in 1996.

The only two WC9 stars in the observed sample that do not make circumstellar dust, WR 81 (He3{$\pm$}1316) and WR 92 (HD 157451), are found to have anomalously weak O ii and strong He ii lines.

Phase diagrams (thermal pressure P versus hydrogen density n) are presented for gas that is illuminated by local interstellar far-ultraviolet (FUV) and X-ray radiation fields. A stable two-phase medium is produced with thermal pressure in the range P/k approximately = to 103-4 K/cc. We demonstrate that photoelectric heating from PAHs dominates in the warm neutral phase (WNM) and cold neutral phase (CNM). If the C II (158 micrometers cooling per hydrogen nucleus in the solar neighborhood represents an average value for the Galaxy, we predict LCII approximately = to 7 x 107 solar luminosities from the CNM in the Galaxy, comparable to that observed by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE).

Meanwhile termed Wolf-Rayet Stars after their discoverers, those objects turned out to represent important stages in the life of massive stars. As the first conference in a long time that was specifically dedicated to Wolf-Rayet stars, an international workshop was held in Potsdam, Germany, from 1.-5. June 2015. About 100 participants, comprising most of the leading experts in the field as well as as many young scientists, gathered for one week of extensive scientific exchange and discussions. Considerable progress has been reported throughout, e.g. on finding  such stars, modeling and analyzing their spectra, understanding their evolutionary context, and studying their circumstellar nebulae. While some major questions regarding Wolf-Rayet stars still remain open 150 years after their discovery, it is clear today that these objects are not just interesting stars as such, but also keystones in the evolution of galaxies. These proceedings summarize the talks and posters presented at the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet workshop. Moreover, they also include the questions, comments, and discussions emerging after each talk, thereby giving a rare overview not only about the research, but also about the current debates and unknowns in the field. The Scientific Organizing Committee (SOC) included Alceste Bonanos (Athens), Paul Crowther (Sheffield), John Eldridge (Auckland), Wolf-Rainer Hamann (Potsdam, Chair), John Hillier (Pittsburgh), Claus Leitherer (Baltimore), Philip Massey (Flagstaff), George Meynet (Geneva), Tony Moffat (Montreal), Nicole St-Louis (Montreal), and Dany Vanbeveren (Brussels).},

What sets Introductory Nuclear Physics apart from other books on the subject is its presentation of nuclear physics as an integral part of modern physics. Placing the discipline within a broad historical and scientific context, it makes important connections to other fields such as elementary particle physics and astrophysics. Now fully revised and updated, this Second Edition explores the changing directions in nuclear physics, emphasizing new developments and current research-from superdeformation to quark-gluon plasma. Author Samuel S.M. Wong preserves those areas that established the First Edition as a standard text in university physics departments, focusing on what is exciting about the discipline and providing a concise, thorough, and accessible treatment of the fundamental aspects of nuclear properties. In this new edition, Professor Wong: * Includes a chapter on heavy-ion reactions-from high-spin states to quark-gluon plasma * Adds a new chapter on nuclear astrophysics * Relates observed nuclear properties to the underlying nuclear interaction and the symmetry principles governing subatomic particles * Regroups material and appendices to make the text easier to use * Lists Internet links to essential databases and research projects * Features end-of-chapter exercises using real-world data. Introductory Nuclear Physics, Second Edition is an ideal text for courses in nuclear physics at the senior undergraduate or first-year graduate level. It is also an important resource for scientists and engineers working with nuclei, for astrophysicists and particle physicists, and for anyone wishing to learn more about trends in the field.},

The speckle interferograms were obtained with the 6 m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory. The twodimensional visibility function of the object does not show any significant deviation from circular symmetry. The visibility curve declines towards the diffraction cut-off frequency to {$\sim$}0.66 and can be approximated by a linear function. Radiative transfer calculations have been carried out to model the spectral energy distribution, given in the range of 0.5\textendash 25 \textmu m, and our 2.13 \textmu m visibility function, assuming spherical symmetry of the dust shell. Both can be fitted with a model containing double-sized grains (``small'' and ``large'') with the radii of a = 0.05 \textmu m and 0.38 \textmu m, and a mass fraction of the large grains greater than 65\%. Alternatively, a good match can be obtained with the grain size distribution function n(a) {$\sim$} a-3, with a ranging between 0.005 \textmu m and 0.6 \textmu m. At the inner boundary of the modelled dust shell (angular diameter {$\Theta$}in = (17{$\pm$}1) mas), the temperature of the smallest grains and the dust shell density are 1750 K {$\pm$} 100 K and (1 {$\pm$} 0.2) \texttimes{} 10-19 g/cm3, respectively.

Analysis of these high-quality data showed that the spectral lines in this massive binary are broadened (full width at half-maximum, FWHM ~=~1400~km s-1) and marginally blueshifted ({$\sim-$}100~km s-1). A direct modelling of these high-resolution spectra in the framework of the standard colliding stellar wind (CSW) picture provided a very good correspondence between the shape of the theoretical and observed spectra. Also, the theoretical line profiles are in most cases an acceptable representation of the observed ones. We applied the CSW model to the X-ray spectra of WR~48a~from previous observations: Chandra-HETG (2012 October) and XMM\textendash Newton~(2008 January). From this expanded analysis, we find that the observed X-ray emission from WR~48a~is variable on the long time-scale (years) and the same is valid for its intrinsic X-ray emission. This requires variable mass-loss rates over the binary orbital period. The X-ray absorption (in excess of that from the stellar winds in the binary) is variable as well. We note that lower intrinsic X-ray emission is accompanied by higher X-ray absorption. A qualitative explanation could be that the presence of clumpy and non-spherically symmetric stellar winds may play a role.},

Large distances, high extinction, and short timescales of critical evolutionary phases make observations of these processes challenging. Lacking good observational guidance, theoretical models have remained controversial. This review offers a basic description of the collapse of a massive molecular core and a critical discussion of the three competing concepts of massive star formation: {$\blacksquare$} monolithic collapse in isolated cores {$\blacksquare$} competitive accretion in a protocluster environment {$\blacksquare$} stellar collisions and mergers in very dense systems We also review the observed outflows, multiplicity, and clustering properties of massive stars, the upper initial mass function and the upper mass limit. We conclude that high-mass star formation is not merely a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation with higher accretion rates, but partly a mechanism of its own, primarily owing to the role of stellar mass and radiation pressure in controlling the dynamics.},

The dust grains acquire mainly positive electrical charge, move with suprathermal drift velocities and may grow up to 100\textendash 200 \AA{} as a result of implantation of impinging carbon ions. For most of the stars the fraction of condensed carbon does not exceed 1 per cent. While the nature of the grain nucleation remains unknown, the condensation distances and the grain seed production can be estimated by fitting the observational spectra with theoretical ones.},

  abstract = {The extinction curves of single clouds, seen towards the stars HD 147165, 179406 and 202904, have been modelled using various mixtures containing both the bare and inhomogeneous (composite and/or multilayer) grains. It has been shown that the models composed of the bare graphite and silicate grains together with the multilayer grains containing silicates, organic refractory and water ice, are more useful in explaining extinction under the reduced cosmic abundances. The models based on Mathis' composite grains or on Greenberg \& Li's core-mantle grains can also provide quite good fits of the extinction and the measured scattering parameters, but still require an excessive amount of carbon which results in too large a C/O ratio. The inhomogeneous grains essentially contribute to the extinction in practically the whole wavelength range of our extinction curves. As a rule, such grains have quite wide size distributions, centred at around 100 nm, although graphite grains are mainly of small sizes.},
