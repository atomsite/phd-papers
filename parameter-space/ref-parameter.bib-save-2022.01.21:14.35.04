                   (WR) stars at known distances, based in part upon
                   recent large-scale spectroscopic surveys. Application
                   to 246 WR stars located in the field permits us to
                   map their Galactic distribution. As anticipated, WR
                   stars generally lie in the thin disc ({$\sim$}40\,pc
                   half-width at half-maximum) between Galactocentric
                   radii 3.5\textendash 10\,kpc, in accordance with
                   other star formation tracers. We highlight 12 WR
                   stars located at vertical distances
                   of~{$\geq$}300\,pc from the mid-plane. Analysis of
                   the radial variation in WR subtypes exposes a
                   ubiquitously higher NWC/NWN ratio than predicted by
                   stellar evolutionary models accounting for stellar
                   rotation. Models for non-rotating stars or accounting
                   for close binary evolution are more consistent with
                   observations. We consolidate information acquired
                   about the known WR content of the Milky Way to build
                   a simple model of the complete population. We derive
                   observable quantities over a range of wavelengths,
                   allowing us to estimate a total number of
                   1900\,~{$\pm~$}\,250 Galactic WR stars, implying an
                   average duration of~{$\sim$}\,0.4\,Myr for the WR
                   phase at the current Milky Way star formation rate.
                   Of relevance to future spectroscopic surveys, we use
                   this model WR population to predict follow-up
                   spectroscopy to KS\, {$\simeq$} \,17.5~mag will be
                   necessary to identify 95\,per\,cent of Galactic WR
                   stars. We anticipate that ESA's Gaia mission will
                   make few additional WR star discoveries via
                   low-resolution spectroscopy, though will
                   significantly refine existing distance
                   determinations. Appendix~A provides a complete
                   inventory of 322 Galactic WR stars discovered since

                   (Z = 0.001, 0.008, and 0.020). Both constant SF and
                   coeval models indicate that SNe are net dust
                   destroyers at all metallicities. Constant SF models
                   at LMC-like metallicities show that AGB stars

                   of 2\textendash 3, whereas at solar metallicities WC
                   binaries are the dominant source of dust for

                   the dust input of WC binaries. Coeval population
                   models show that, for ``bursty'' SF, AGB stars

                   thought to be immediate precursors to the supernova
                   terminating their brief lives. The existence of dust
                   shells around such stars has been enigmatic since
                   their discovery some 30 years ago; the intense
                   radiation field from the star should be inimical to
                   dust survival. Although dust-creation models,
                   including those involving interacting stellar winds
                   from a companion star, have been put forward,
                   high-resolution observations are required to
                   understand this phenomena. Here we present resolved
                   images of the dust outflow around Wolf-Rayet WR 104,
                   obtained with novel imaging techniques, revealing
                   detail on scales corresponding to about 40 AU at the
                   star. Our maps show that the dust forms a spatially
                   confined stream following precisely a linear (or
                   Archimedian) spiral trajectory. Images taken at two
                   separate epochs show a clear rotation with a period
                   of 220 +/- 30 days. Taken together, these findings
                   prove that a binary star is responsible for the
                   creation of the circumstellar dust, while the spiral
                   plume makes WR 104 the prototype of a new class of
                   circumstellar nebulae unique to interacting wind

                   Nonthermal radio emission may be observed only if the
                   orbital period of the binary is more than some
                   critical value. For a typical Wolf-Rayet binary the
                   value of the critical period is of the order of a
                   month when the frequency of observation is a few GHz.
                   Observations of nonthermal radio emission of the
                   remarkable Wolf-Rayet binary WR 140, such as

                   algorithms. The modules show excellent performance
                   and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efficiency

                   identification as a `rotating pinwheel nebulae',
                   where infrared images display a spiral dust lane
                   revolving with a 1.4 yr periodicity. WR 98a hosts a
                   WC9+OB star, and the presence of dust is puzzling
                   given the extreme luminosities of Wolf\textendash
                   Rayet stars. We present 3D hydrodynamic models for WR
                   98a, where dust creation and redistribution are
                   self-consistently incorporated. Our grid-adaptive
                   simulations resolve details in the wind collision
                   region at scales below one percent of the orbital
                   separation ({$\sim$}4 au), while simulating up to
                   1300 au. We cover several orbital periods under
                   conditions where the gas component alone behaves
                   adiabatic, or is subject to effective radiative
                   cooling. In the adiabatic case, mixing between
                   stellar winds is effective in a well-defined spiral
                   pattern, where optimal conditions for dust creation
                   are met. When radiative cooling is incorporated, the
                   interaction gets dominated by thermal instabilities
                   along the wind collision region, and dust
                   concentrates in clumps and filaments in a
                   volume-filling fashion, so WR 98a must obey close to
                   adiabatic evolutions to demonstrate the rotating
                   pinwheel structure. We mimic Keck, ALMA or future
                   E-ELT observations and confront photometric long-term
                   monitoring. We predict an asymmetry in the dust
                   distribution between leading and trailing edge of the
                   spiral, show that ALMA and E-ELT would be able to

  abstract =      {We model the dynamics, the destruction by sputtering,
                   and the infrared (IR) emission from collisionally
                   heated dust grains in fast ({$\geq$} 400 km s-1)
                   astrophysical shocks in order to develop IR
                   diagnostics for the destruction of grains in these
                   environments. The calculations take into account the
                   feedback from sputtering and IR emission on the
                   gas-phase abundances, the cooling, and the ionization
                   and thermal structure of the shock. Sputtering
                   changes the initial grain size distribution, creating
                   a deficiency of small (radius {$<$}50 \AA ) grains
                   compared to their preshock abundances. The altered
                   grain size distribution depends on shock velocity and
                   the density of the interstellar medium. Dust
                   particles with sizes below {$\asymp$}300 \AA{} are
                   stochastically heated, undergo temperature
                   fluctuations, and radiate an excess of near-infrared
                   emission ({$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 40 {$\mu$}m) over that
                   expected for grains in thermal equilibrium. This
                   near-infrared excess is a measure of the abundance of
                   small grains and therefore a powerful diagnostic for
                   the amount of destruction the grains were subjected
                   to in the shock. We present here IR spectra from
                   collisionally heated dust for a variety of shocks,
                   and depict the changes in the spectra as a function
                   of postshock column density. Our studies compliment
                   those of Vancura et al. that examined the effects of
                   the release of the sputtered refractory elements on
                   the ultraviolet and X-ray emission. Multiwavelength
                   observations at X-ray, UV, and IR wavelengths are
                   therefore essential in piecing together a
                   comprehensive picture of the physics of grain
                   destruction in fast astrophysical shocks.},

                   spiral Pinwheel Nebula observed around the
                   Wolf\textendash Rayet/OB-star binary WR 104. The
                   models are based on the three-dimensional
                   radiative-transfer code torus, modified to include an
                   adaptive mesh that allows us to adequately resolve
                   both the inner spiral turns (subau scales) and the
                   outer regions of the nebula (distances of 104 au from
                   the central source). The spiral model provides a good
                   fit to both the spectral energy distribution and Keck
                   aperture masking interferometry, reproducing both the
                   maximum entropy recovered images and the visibility
                   curves. We deduce a dust creation rate of 8 {$\pm$} 1
                   \texttimes{} 10-7 M{$\odot$} yr-1, corresponding to
                   approximately 2 per cent by mass of the carbon
                   produced by the Wolf\textendash Rayet star.
                   Simultaneous modelling of the imaging and spectral
                   data enables us to constrain both the opening angle
                   of the wind\textendash wind collision interface and
                   the dust grain size. We conclude that the dust grains
                   in the inner part of the Pinwheel Nebula are small
                   ({$\sim$}100 \AA ), in agreement with theoretical
                   predictions, although we cannot rule out the presence
                   of larger grains ({$\sim$}1 {$\mu$}m) further from
                   the central binary. The opening angle of the
                   wind\textendash wind collision interface appears to
                   be about 40\textdegree, in broad agreement with the
                   wind parameters estimated for the central binary. We
                   discuss the success and deficiencies of the model,
                   and the likely benefits of applying similar
                   techniques to the more complex nebulae observed
                   around other WR/O star binaries.},

                   massive stellar binaries are investigated using 3D
                   hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the
                   driving of the winds, the orbital motion of the stars
                   and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. In this
                   first paper, we restrict our study to main-sequence
                   O+O binaries. The nature of the wind\textendash wind
                   collision region is highly dependent on the degree of
                   cooling of the shocked plasma, and the ratio of the
                   flow time-scale of the shocked plasma to the orbital
                   time-scale. The pre-shock wind speeds are lower in
                   close systems as the winds collide prior to their
                   acceleration to terminal speeds. Radiative inhibition
                   may also reduce the pre-shock wind speeds. Together,
                   these effects can lead to rapid cooling of the
                   post-shock gas. Radiative inhibition is less
                   important in wider systems, where the winds are
                   accelerated to higher speeds before they collide, and
                   the resulting collision region can be largely
                   adiabatic. In systems with eccentric orbits, cold gas
                   formed during periastron passage can persist even at
                   apastron, before being ablated and mixed into its
                   surroundings and/or accelerated out of the system.},
